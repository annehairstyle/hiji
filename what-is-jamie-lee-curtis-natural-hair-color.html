She’s one of Hollywood’s most well-known faces, but what’s her natural hair colour?</p><p><strong>Jamie Lee Curtis has fully embraced her changing natural hair color, and proudly flaunts her natural grey hair. She has a natural whitish-gray color, which she wears in her, now iconic, pixie cut.</strong></p><p>Read on to learn more about Jamie Lee Curtis’s Hollywood career, her struggle with addiction, and her decision to embrace her natural self and hair color.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Jamie Lee Curtis?</h2><p>Jamie Lee Curtis became an overnight success when she starred in cult horror film <a href=# rel=noopener>‘Halloween’</a>. Though she starred in a string of horror movies, and most recently reprised her role in the ‘Halloween franchise’, her work has spanned many genres.</p><p>In addition to her wildly successful film career, Curtis is also an established <a href=# rel=noopener>children’s author.</a></p><p>Watch Jamie Lee Curtis discuss her career with Vanity Fair, in the YouTube video below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Beauty Standards and Addiction</h2><p>Jamie Lee Curtus has been very open about her addiction to painkillers and how it came to pass. Speaking to <a href=# rel=noopener>Variety</a>, she explained that a cameraman had refused to shoot her because her eyes were too puffy.</p><p>She added, “I was so mortified and so embarrassed and had just so much shame about it that after that movie, I went and had routine plastic surgery to remove the puffiness. They gave me Vicodin as a painkiller for something that wasn’t really painful.”</p><p>Curtis became addicted to the drug, <a href=# rel=noopener>calling</a> herself the “wildly controlled drug addict and alcoholic” as she would never do it at work, and nursed her addiction for 10 years in secret.&nbsp;</p><p>It was when a friend accidentally observed Curtis swallowing pills and expressed her concern that Curtis began to think about facing up to her addiction, and soon after she attended her first recovery meeting. She’s remained sober ever since.</p><p>Plastic surgery was the cause of her painkiller addiction and she struggled to maintain the industry’s beauty ideals, like many actresses in the limelight.&nbsp;</p><p>She told <a href=# rel=noopener>The Telegraph</a> in 2002, “I’ve done it all. I’ve had a little plastic surgery. I’ve had a little lipo. I’ve had a little Botox. And you know what? None of it works. None of it”.</p><p>She <a href=# rel=noopener>added</a> that plastic surgery comes with an element of risk and reflected that “there is this illusion that once you do it, then you’ll be fine. And that’s just horseshit. I looked worse”.</p><p>She has since <a href=# rel=noopener>vowed</a> to accept her natural looks and has made permanent lifestyle changes to improve her life and her family’s life.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Natural Beauty</h2><p>Whilst in her youth Jamie Lee Curtis had very different hair, which often changed according to whichever role she was cast in, Curtis now prefers to keep it natural and embrace her natural ageing.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Yahoo News</a> reported that she stopped dying her hair in 2017 as “she didn’t want to put burning chemicals on her head anymore”.</p><p>She has whitish-gray hair which she styles in her signature pixie cut, and she constantly features in style guides, particularly for older women.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Sixty and Me</a> called her “a great ad for short hair for older women”, giving advice on how to recreate her style.</p><p>Curtis told <a href=# rel=noopener>The Telegraph</a>, “I’m trying hard to take the veil off the fraud, to be real, to start with me”, emphasizing her commitment to embracing her natural look.</p><p>She complements her short grey do with bright outfits and quirky tailored fashions and in 2018, <a href=# rel=noopener>Vogue</a> ran a feature on ‘Why Jamie Lee Curtis is Having a Style Renaissance’ which praised the star’s outfit choices, which suit her specifically rather than following trends.</p><p>Her stylist, Jane Ross, <a href=# rel=noopener>said</a> of the actress “she’s wildly cool”, adding “Jamie wears the clothes, they don’t wear her”.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCfmqxdnsButsCmoJ5lnJqybq%2FUq6uiq12jrrXB0ZqjZqCRnr9ur86lpqtn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-s-inside-and-why-everyone-is-talking-about-it-the-talks-today.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What's Inside and Why Everyone is Talking About It The Talks Today">&larr;
