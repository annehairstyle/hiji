He feels like he has a lot of love to offer, but doesn't want to waste it on someone who isn't fully committed to him. He also acknowledges that he's been drinking to cope with the situation, but he's ready to work through it and be with her.</p><br><p>The chorus repeats the phrase "I think that I'm done trippin', I'm trip-trippin'" which could be interpreted in a few different ways. It could mean that he's done being confused and is ready to make a decision about their relationship, or it could mean that he's finally sobering up and seeing things more clearly. The line "Got a whole lot of love, ain't tryna waste it" emphasizes that he has a lot to offer and wants to make sure that it's not being taken for granted.</p><br><p>The rap section towards the end of the song addresses some of the specific ways that she's been playing games with him, such as telling him they're just friends one minute and then acting like they're more than that the next. Despite this, he's willing to put in the work to make it work, and he acknowledges that his feelings for her are too strong to just walk away.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>I gotta ride with my gun on safety So I don't go shootin' where your nigga be Girl you dodging bullets tryna play me (you know it) Then I'm left to deal with how you made me</u><br>I have to keep my gun safe, so I don't accidentally hurt your man, and you're playing games, which may result in danger, leaving me in a difficult position.</p><br><p><u>Got a whole lot of love, ain't tryna waste it You got me runnin' around and I never chase it (yeah) Your face so pretty to me, makeup ain't make it (nah) Your face so pretty to me, makeup can't make it</u><br>I have a lot of love for you that I don't want to waste, I follow you without needing an extra push, your natural face is beautiful to me, and makeup doesn't make it any better.</p><br><p><u>But I think that I'm done trippin', I'm trip-trippin' (woah, woah, right) I've been sippin', that's how I control (woah, right, right, woah) This feelin', you keep givin' (woah, right, yeah) And I keep on hittin' it, you know (woah)</u><br>I've realized that I've been overthinking and stressing out, so I'm done with it, I'm controlling my emotions by drinking, but you keep giving me these feelings that I can't resist, and so I keep coming back to you.</p><br><p><u>I could be the perfect young nigga for ya (alright) Baby girl, your love got me trippin' on you (alright) You know my love is big enough, got you trippin' on me (what) Yeah it's big enough got you trippin' on me Trip, trippin' on me My bad, it's your bad, for you trippin' on me (trippin' on me, yeah, what, right) My bad, it's your bad, for you trippin' on me (trippin' on me)</u><br>I am a great partner for you, and your love has made me fall for you, and in turn, you have fallen for me too, and that's not entirely your fault.
