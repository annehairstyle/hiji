Bieber is known for his fashion choices, but does he need to wear glasses or other corrective lenses?</p><p><strong>It’s thought that Justin Bieber does not need glasses. Bieber reportedly has perfect 20/20 vision, but sometimes chooses to wear non-prescription lenses with a wide variety of frames as a part of his look.</strong></p><p>Read more below to find out about Justin Bieber’s glasses looks as well as his other interests in fashion.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bieber in Glasses</h2><p>Bieber has had a lot of support from his fans since the beginning of his career, and fans have loved him in glasses all throughout his time in the spotlight. One fan even put together <a href=# rel=noopener>this comprehensive Twitter thread</a> of Bieber wearing glasses throughout his career, from the thicker block glasses he preferred when he was younger to his more recent affinity for wireframes.</p><p>So Bieber definitely wears glasses, but some people became curious after seeing him wear glasses so often, questioning whether he actually needs to wear them or contact to be able to see. He doesn’t actually any corrective lenses, as according to <a href=# rel=noopener>The Big Book of Bieber</a>, he has perfect vision, but he wears them purely for fashion purposes.</p><p>He actually started a glasses trend early on in his career, with the release of his first concert film called <a href=# rel=noopener>Justin Bieber: Never Say Never</a>, in 2011. This was the first of the films he was in, and features Bieber getting ready for the biggest performance in his career at the time in <a href=# rel=noopener>Madison Square Garden</a>.</p><p>The film became a box office success and was shown in 3-D. The trend started with those 3-D glasses that fans used to watch the film, which were modeled after Bieber’s preferred style of glasses at the time, with thick, boxy frames, and in his favorite color, purple.</p><p>Fans who saw the movie would then pop the 3-D lenses out to wear them whenever they wanted, and doing this was very popular after the movie was released. In <a href=# rel=noopener>this Tweet</a>, a fan references that fashion, joking, “anyone got a spare pair of 2011 edition justin bieber never say never purple 3d glasses with the lenses popped out??? tryna get ahead on coachella fashion this year.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Drew House</h2><p>The purple glasses fad wasn’t the only fashion trend that Justin Bieber started. For fashion, he is mostly known for his comfortable streetwear, so much so that he even started his own clothing line to sell more of the style.</p><p>The line, which he named <a href=# rel=noopener>Drew House</a> after his middle name, Drew, <a href=# rel=noopener>featuring</a> comfortable, loose-fitting clothing in both bright and more neutral colors. The clothes are reasonably priced compared to other celebrity brands, and most have the Drew House branding of a yellow smiley face with the word “Drew” in the place of the mouth.</p><p>All of the clothing and accessories put on the site are ethically made in <a href=# rel=noopener>Los Angeles</a>, making the line completely vegan. There are limited amounts of each piece made, though, so a lot of the pieces on the site are already sold out.</p><p>Bieber didn’t strongly promote the line, and let the news of Drew House spread through word-of-mouth, which didn’t hurt his sales at all, as the line was sold out almost immediately after its release in 2018.</p><p>One of the most compelling factors of the brand is their mission statement, which focuses their audience at a younger age. The tagline reads, “drew house is a place where you can be yourself. blah blah blah blahsdbksjdfhl wear like you don’t care. come chill. k. bye.”&nbsp;</p><p>The statement goes along with their word-of-mouth promotion style, reading like it was sent as a text message to a friend.</p><p>Check out the YouTube video below for more information on Bieber’s clothing line, Drew House.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jp2mnqtdn8K0wMinZJuhlZeys3nWnpirZZehrrS%2FxKxm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./elliott-moscato-derby-ct-obituary-elliott-moscato-has-died.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Elliott Moscato Derby CT Obituary Elliott Moscato Has Died">&larr;
