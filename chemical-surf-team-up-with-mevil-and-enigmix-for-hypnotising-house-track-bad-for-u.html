This is the follow-up to Chemical Surf’s collaboration with Jetlag Music on the single “Kids”, Mevil’s collaboration with Ghabe and Dainez on the track “Never Enough”, and Enigmix’s collaboration with Low Disco on the single “Shake” and precedes his new single “One Night” which is a collaboration with Costæd.</p><p>Chemical Surf are a Brazilian brother duo composed of Lucas and Hugo Sanches. They are known for their high energy and rhythmic style, and have worked with notable artists such as Kaskade and Steve Aoki, as well as putting their own spin on popular songs like MEDUZA’s “Tell It To My Heart”. They have released music on a variety of labels such as Dim Mak, Spinnin’ Records, STMPD RCRDS, Musical Freedom, Armada, Sony, and Warner. They stand out in the electronic music scene by breaking the boundaries between genres and showcasing their high musical sensibility. They’re clearly a rising duo to keep an eye on as they’ve been dropping awesome new singles this year, as proven by the collaboration with Fancy Inc, titled “<a href=#>Darkness</a>“, so we’re excited to see what the future has in store for them.</p><p>As for Mevil, real name Matheus Nobre, the project emerged in 2020 when the artist decided he wanted to seek a new path in music. Quite the conquerer on the national EDM and house scene with some great original lyrics and huge incredible productions. Under this new project, he had a huge hit in collaboration with Chemical Surf and Ghabe on the single “Tell Me”, in 2021, which gained over a million streams across platforms, and went on to receive support from the likes of the biggest DJs in the world including Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, David Guetta, and R3HAB. On top of that, his second most-streamed song on Spotify, after “Tell Me”, is his collaboration with ZERB and Calvin Duo, which has over 411k streams on the platform. Mevil is certainly a rising project that we all need to keep an eye on as he makes an impact with his incredible music.</p><p>Then there’s Enigmix, who is a DJ and producer whose real name is Cícero Ribeiro. The project was born around the creativity of music, art, and culture which can be found in the city of Salvador. He has quickly established himself in the EDM world, going on to gain over a million Spotify streams and for two years became the most-played artist in Bahia. In doing so, he’s managed to secure releases on some of the biggest record labels in the world, including Sony/HUB Record, Blacktone, and Warner Music. His production and music composition has been described as unique and is always a DJ who loves a surprise, not just in his music but also during the parties that he hosts in Salvador. His determination and belief in himself are exactly the type of energy needed to make it in the dance music world.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Watch the awesome visualiser for “Bad For U” by Chemical Surf, Mevil & Enigmix here:</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Written and produced by the artists themselves, “Bad For U” is definitely a summer drum and bass dance track that is certainly going to smash dancefloors this year, using the hypnotic beat to cause a rhythmic movement in every listener. The vocals are sultry and teasing adding depth and perception to break the instrumental up a bit, allowing the focus to be on the awesome kicking bassline that drives into different synth drops allowing the entire melody to warp into one driving powerful force that is going to be a highlight in many sets from the festivals to the clubs. This is the must-have track on any dance, house, and trance setlist and playlist. We expect a heavy rotation of this track for summer 2023.</p><p>Talking about the track, Chemical Surf said: “‘Bad For U’ is a secret weapon in our sets since we made it. It’s making big crowds dance and also working very well in the clubs, and that’s why we are playing this song everywhere. Finally, it’s time to share it with the world. When we received the first idea from Mevil and Enigmix, we felt it could be something special. We worked on all the drums, build-up, construction of the track, and some details on the synths, and also mixed and mastered it later by ourselves. After that, we all were very happy with the result.”</p><p>Mevil added: “This is my 2nd collab with Enigmix and my 3rd with Chemical Surf. I was looking for a groovy song, so he sent me the vocals, and I got hyped since the first play on it. Then I just put the vocal on FL Studio, and 2 hours later, the main idea of the song was done.”</p><p>On top of that, Enigmix went on to say: “After Mevil sent me the main idea, I added a few synths and improved the whole groove of the song, and we decided to reach out to Chemical Surf for a collab.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Stream the brand-new collaborative single on Spotify here:</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify wp-embed-aspect-21-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>“Bad For U”, by Chemical Surf, Mevil & Enigmix, is available to download and stream, right now, across all platforms, via Dim Mak’s house imprint A Good One.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Let us know what you make of “Bad For U” by Chemical Surf, Mevil & Enigmix, on Twitter <a href=#>@CelebMix.</a></h4><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ksKmxzKKamqRdqMKzsoytnJqlXaq9bsPIrZ9mpZWrtq15wKebZp2enrSutddmnaiqXZ3GsbrOraCsoZ6ceqm71KycZqyilrCsecGam2aen6d6tns%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./debra-messing-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Debra Messing Net Worth">&larr;
