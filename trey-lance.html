He hasn’t played many professional matches, so his earnings are now modest. He was unable to earn much over the years because collegiate players are not compensated.<strong> His net worth is expected to reach around $500,000 in 2022,</strong> with the majority of his assets and fortune coming from his family.</p><h2><span id=Trey_Lance-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Parents>Trey Lance- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Parents</span></h2><p>Trey Lance was born to Carlton and Angie Lance on May 12th, 2000 in Marshall, Minnesota, United States. His father is black, and his mother is White Caucasian, hence he is of mixed ancestry. His father was also a football player at Southwest Minnesota State, where he played cornerback. He also played in the Canadian Football League for the Saskatchewan Roughriders and the World League of American Football for the London Monarchs. Throughout his high school and college years, Trey was primarily trained by his father. Bryce Lance, his younger brother, is also a member of “Bison” and enrolled at NDSU in 2021. He is currently 20 years old and is a Christian.</p><p>Trey finished his middle school schooling at a nearby school and began playing football at the position of quarterback. Later, he attended and graduated from Marshall High School, where he was named Minnesota’s top quarterback. He intended to go to the University of Minnesota to further his education, but he didn’t since he wasn’t recognized as a quarterback prospect, and the team wanted him to play defensive back instead. In 2018, he enrolled in the Strategic Communication department at North Dakota State University, where he also played quarterback football. He is currently in his second year of college.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table style=height:100%;width:100%><tbody><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Trey Lance</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>May 12, 2000</td></tr><tr><td>Age</td><td>20 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Marshall, Minnesota, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>American Football Player</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Sun sign</td><td>Taurus</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 6’ 4” –&nbsp;</strong>in Centimetres&nbsp;<strong>– 193 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 103 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 226 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Chest Size</td><td>42 Inches</td></tr><tr><td>Waist Size</td><td>30 Inches</td></tr><tr><td>Biceps Size</td><td>15 Inches</td></tr><tr><td>Shoe Size</td><td>11 (U.S.)</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td>Body Type</td><td>Athletic</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Trey_Lance_8211_Relationship_Married_Life_Girlfriend>Trey Lance – Relationship, Married Life, Girlfriend</span></h2><p>Trey has kept his personal life, relationships, and friends private. He hasn’t revealed any of his interests or pastimes. He is said to be best friends with his player Phoenix Sproles, as well as childhood friend Jake Hess. Trey Lance was recently linked to Colin Coward’s daughter Liv Coward. On practically every post of Liv’s, he has been spotted leaving repeated and close remarks. This has sparked a lot of interest from those who believe the duo is dating. There is no information about his previous partnerships accessible.</p><h2><span id=Trey_Lance-_Professional_Career>Trey Lance- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Trey began playing football in middle school, and by high school, he had established himself as his father’s finest quarterback. As a Quarterback for the NSDU college football team “Bison,” he began his career. He redshirted his first season of college football in 2018, however, he did play in two games.</p><p>He started the 2019 season as the starting quarterback and performed admirably. The team won several games and advanced to the NCAA Division I Football Championship Game in 2020. When he had 28 touchdowns and no interceptions in the final game, he was dubbed the most valuable player. His outstanding play earned him the Walter Payton Award as the league’s Most Outstanding Offensive Player. He also took up the Jerry Rice Award for a top freshman in the FCS.</p><p>Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the following season of 2020 was postponed, and he was only able to play one exhibition game before the postponement against Central Arkansas, where he had two touchdowns and one interception. Later, he opted out of the season and began preparing for the NFL draft in 2021. In the 2021 NFL Draft, the San Francisco 49ers selected him third overall.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color</span></h2><p><strong>Trey Lance stands 6 ft 4 inches tall and weighs 103 kg.</strong> Furthermore, he has Black hair and Black eyes.</p><h2><span id=Social_Media_Details>Social Media Details</span></h2><p>Cam does not have an official presence on social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, and TikTok.</p><h2><span id=Trivia>Trivia</span></h2><ul><li>Trey owns the NCAA record for most passes thrown without an interception in a season, with 312 passes without interceptions in the 2019 season.</li><li>During high school, Trey was the president of his local Fellowship of Christian Athletes chapter.</li><li>Trey has trained in Atlanta and likes the city and team, according to his friends Sproles.
