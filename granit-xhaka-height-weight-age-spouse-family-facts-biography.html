It was a big claim as Shaqiri was considered as the finest talent to have emerged from Switzerland in decades. However, Xhaka has shown flashes of immense talent since having made his debut for Basel. His ability to strike cleanly from the distance has made him a fan favorite at all the clubs he had played for. His passing range is also great but his indiscipline and inconsistency have stopped him from becoming the player that everyone who is close to him had hoped for.</p><h3>Born Name</h3><p>Granit Xhaka</p><h3>Nick Name</h3><p>Granit</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Granit-Xhaka-during-a-game-in-August-2018.jpg><h3>Sun Sign</h3><p>Libra</p><h3>Born Place</h3><p>Basel, Switzerland</p><h3>Nationality</h3><p><img decoding=async title=Swiss src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Switzerland.png alt=Swiss width=64 height=44 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3></h3><h3>Education</h3><p>Granit Xhaka started his soccer journey at the youth setup of&nbsp;<strong>Concordia Basel</strong>.
