Could these two actors share something in common apart from their stellar performances in movies?</p><p><strong>No, Tom Cruise is not related to Charlie Sheen. What they share in common is the fact that they are both good actors. Also, they have been rivals for some movie roles. Find out more about their complicated relationship in this article</strong>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Rivalry</h2><p>Can you imagine another <a href=# rel=noopener>Ron Kovic</a> apart from Tom Cruise and of course the<a href=# rel=noopener> real Ron Kovic</a>? Well, Charlie Sheen could have played the role of Ron Kovic in the 1989 hit movie, Born on the 4th of July. <a href=# rel=noopener>According to Sheen</a>, the movie director, Oliver Stone, had offered him the role initially. Sheen insists that Stone had promised to give him the movie role but went on to give the role to Tom without informing him. He only found out that Tom Cruise had been cast for the role of his brother, Emilio Estevez.</p><p>Both actors were still fresh stars in the movie industry, and there was no doubt that they could have fared well in the role. Tom got the part, and it was a major boost in his career. It is believed that the movie director settled for Tom because he was the bigger name at the time. <a href=# rel=noopener>Sheen was hurt</a> and told Playboy that he would have appreciated if Stone had called to tell him that he changed his mind. Of course, the silence can be painful, and such a situation is better imagined. However, the movie director has neither confirmed nor dismissed Sheen’s claim.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>It was also noted that</a> Tom had been interested in playing the role of <a href=# rel=noopener>Bud Fox in Wall Street</a>, but Oliver Stone cast Charlie for the role instead. <a href=# rel=noopener>Charlie was also considered for the role of Maverick</a> in Top gun, but Tom got the role eventually. However, Charlie after the parody to the movie, <a href=# rel=noopener>Hot Shots</a>!, later on. There has definitely been a competition between the two stars.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Two Worlds Apart</h2><p>Charlie Sheen had a good start in his career. Born to actor Martin Sheen, he grew up watching his father and fell in love with the profession. Some<a href=# rel=noopener> of his high school buddies were also acting like Rob Lowe and Sean Penn</a>. His first movie was produced by his father and directed by Oliver Stone.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Tom Cruise</a>, on the other hand, did not have such a smooth entry into the movie industry. Tom grew up in a Catholic background and had considered becoming a reverend father. He had no clue that he would end up being a movie star until he was 18 and decided to pursue his passion in the movie industry. With the blessings of his parents, he auditioned for several roles until he got his first break into the movie industry. Tom Cruise had to go for several auditions, despite battling with dyslexia to land his first role</p><p>One would say both stars live in world’s apart and had different exposure to the movie industry. They also do not act in similar movies. Thus, apart from acting movies with the same movie director and being Hollywood stars, they are not related.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jq2mpmWTp8Kqv8RmmqGZoqG2pnnSoZyepl8%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-tony-hawk-related-to-steve-hawk-of-good-bones-steve-hawk-sister-stephanie-hawk-and-parents.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Tony Hawk Related To Steve Hawk Of Good Bones?
