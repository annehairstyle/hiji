Throughout his time at the university, he was part of the Delta Upsilon fraternity</strong><strong>, which is where he spent a lot of his time making videos for video platform Vine.</strong></p><p>With over 190 million YouTube views and counting, 1.5+ million Instagram followers, 600K+ Twitter fans, 1.6+ million Facebook likes, and 3.2+ million followers on Tik Tok, there’s no doubt that Trevor has made a big footprint on the social media world. How did he do it?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Camarillo and San Jose Days</h2><p>On the 30th of December in 1992, Trevor was born in Hollywood, Florida at the Memorial Regional Hospital. He was then moved across the country to the west, where he grew up in Camarillo in California, not far from Hollywood in Los Angeles.</p><p>He attended <a href=# rel=noopener>Adolfo Camarillo High School</a>, and he describes his hometown as rather small and quiet. Though, he did have some interesting experiences during his high school, like the one he describes below involving a fight on the street: (profanity warning)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>After finishing high school, Trevor went on to attend San Jose State University and joined the <a href=# rel=noopener>Delta Upsilon fraternity</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Below, the fraternity’s Instagram page posted about the alum’s birthday in 2013, captioning, “Happy birthday to our vine famous brother Trevor Wallace & DU’s very own comedian! ??”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p>Delta Upsilon was founded in 1934, and it is the sixth oldest all-male fraternity organization in North America. <a href=# rel=noopener>Trevor is listed</a> among the Delta Upsilon brothers as an “Internet star” in the film and television category.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A Viral Star</h2><p>Trevor hasn’t revealed what he was studying throughout his time at the university, but it was during his studies that he opened a profile on now discontinued <a href=# rel=noopener>video hosting service Vine</a>. The social networking app had more than 200 million active followers at its peak in 2015, and Trevor didn’t wait long to jump on the bandwagon.</p><p>In the course of his time in the fraternity, Wallace also set up a YouTube channel in late 2011. He began posting comedic clips to the site, discovering that it was the better platform to grow on after <a href=# rel=noopener>the death of vine</a>.</p><p>His first video to hit a million views on YouTube was titled “Life As A Zumiez Employee” uploaded on August 1st in 2017, and he continued to post frequently after that. Following his first big hit, some of his videos accumulated several millions of views, though it wasn’t consistent.</p><p>Things started to pick up in 2018, with more stable views in the high hundreds of thousands and even millions.&nbsp;</p><p>2019 is when things went especially viral for Wallace, as he uploaded “*drinks White Claw once*” on the 25th of June. His most famous quote, “Ain’t No Laws When You’re Drinking Claws” became a viral hit, and he released a line of shirts with the slogan.</p><p>Beverage company White Claw Hard Seltzer <a href=# rel=noopener>ended up sending him</a> a cease and desist order.</p><p>Wallace had uploaded a video a couple of weeks before his White Claw hit, and it was titled “When Frat Guys Come Home For The Summer”. It was a parody on the stereotypical personalities of frat boys, and racked up 5.9 million views as of 2020.</p><p>Although it wasn’t as big of a success as his White Claw sketch, he continued publishing spoof videos on the tendencies of young men in fraternity communities. These amassed viral attention, and his career in comedy grew from there.</p><p>Since his Vine days, Trevor has moved on to several other social media outlets. Aside from his YouTube channel, he posts comedic sketches on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and Tik Tok.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCfmqxdm7%2BiwMSrpaKsqWLEor%2BMramerp%2Bnerity6WYnJ1dnrtw</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./which-real-car-is-grotti-itali-gto-stinger-tt-in-gta-online-based-on-and-is-it-worth-buying.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Which real car is Grotti Itali GTO Stinger TT in GTA Online based on, and is it worth buying?">&larr;
