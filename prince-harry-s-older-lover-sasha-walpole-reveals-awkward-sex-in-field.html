He made the move. I don’t know why, or what happened, we just had a cigarette and before you know it, it was all happening,” Walpole said, further claiming they were drunk on Sambuca.</p><p>“He kissed me. We were quite drunk and got lost in the moment.”</p><p>Walpole said Prince William was inside the pub at the time, while Harry’s security were in the carpark. In a bid to avoid being caught, the duo “jumped a fence” and had sex in a field.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>She said it lasted about five minutes, before reality quickly set in that she’d “crossed a line”.</p><p>“It seemed like a good idea at the time. I didn’t know [he was a virgin]. [Afterwards] we were kind of like, ‘Oh, okay’ and we decided to go our separate ways to make it look less obvious,” she said.</p><p>“At that point [his security] realised he hadn’t come out of the pub at closing time and they were looking for him. I think they found him down the road. He’d taken off.”</p><p>Walpole said she went back into the pub, where their group of friends were suspicious that something went down.</p><p>“There was quite a few giggles, they knew what happened, and probably knew when security started looking for him,” she said. “Everyone was just like, ‘keep quiet and carry on’.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/JZ34DVIw8ttHvoxCB2yK51DmR5w=/16x10/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/E5RHZ2O6FZGK7NQOBPV3VLROXA.png"><p>Walpole, who said she left her belt in the field and had to go back the next day to look for it, said she was told by a friend the following day that it was Harry’s first time.</p><p>She claimed the pair never spoke again.</p><p>“There was nothing … I think it’s because social circles weren’t happening (at that time). The normal group of people usually buzzing for the summer weren’t around. And then I met my [now] husband at a nightclub and my social circles moved to a different area,” she said.</p><p>“He was a young boy, so for him, it may have been mega awkward.”</p><p>Walpole claimed she found out about the incident being featured in Harry’s book via a WhatsApp chat.</p><span class=ad__heading data-test-ui=ad__heading data-ad-env=both>Advertisement</span><a class=ad__link data-test-ui=ad__link href=# data-ad-env=both>Advertise with NZME.</a><p>“My friend sent me a screenshot,” she said. “I was shocked. In disbelief he went into so much detail, because then it was obvious who it was,” she said. “I almost fell off my sofa.”</p><p>She added, “It should never have happened. We were friends. It’s not really that glorious in a field behind a pub. There was nothing glorious about being drunk and [having sex with] your mate.”</p><p>Writing in his book <i>Spare</i>, Harry described the encounter as a “humiliating episode with an older woman who liked macho horses and who treated me like a young stallion”.</p><p>“I mounted her quickly, after which she spanked my ass and sent me away,” he writes. “One of my many mistakes was letting it happen in a field, just behind a very busy pub. No doubt someone had seen us.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r8bHnqmapJRjsLB6zbNmpaGWmsC1xcueZqmqmaOwpnnHmqmrsaNivK2wxKtkpaemmr9uv8Csn5plp5a5sbvLnmSrnaaarq2%2FjJqupK%2BRp7Fuv8SxZKKmXZu2prjDaIJ%2BhoKEnnemqod5iIh7eYOFlqKSi36RgnmBcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./private-equity-boss-jean-pierre-conte-hit-with-assault-suit-by-hillary-thomas.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Private Equity Boss Jean-Pierre Conte Hit With Assault Suit by Hillary Thomas">&larr;
