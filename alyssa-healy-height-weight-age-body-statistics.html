She was a part of the Australian squads that had won the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup in both 2013 and 2022, the 6th and 7th times, respectively, that Australia had achieved the feat. She has also been an integral member of the Australian squads that have clinched the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup in 2010, 2012, 2014, 2018, and 2020. In the Australian domestic circuit, she has played for New South Wales (2007-08–Present) across all 3 formats. In franchise-based T20 cricket, she has turned out for the Sydney Sixers (2015-16–present) in the WBBL (Women’s Big Bash League); Trailblazers (2018)&nbsp;in the Women’s T20 Challenge; and the Yorkshire Diamonds (2019) in the WCSL (Women’s Cricket Super League). A rare occurrence in modern cricket, Alyssa has also played domestic cricket outside of her home country representing Yorkshire Women’s Cricket Team (2012) in England.</p><h3>Born Name</h3><p>Alyssa Jean Healy</p><h3>Nick Name</h3><p>Midge</p><figure id=attachment_379760 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-379760 style=width:500px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Alyssa Healy as seen in an Instagram Post in March 2021 (Alyssa Healy / Instagram)</figure><h3>Sun Sign</h3><p>Aries</p><h3>Born Place</h3><p>Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia</p><h3>Residence</h3><p>Sydney, New South Wales, Australia</p><h3>Nationality</h3><p></p><h3>Education</h3><p>Alyssa had attended the <strong>MLC School</strong>, an independent day school for girls in Burwood, New South Wales.

She had moved up the state age-group ranks rapidly and had made her debut for the senior New South Wales team in the 2007–08 season.</li><li>During the 2009–10 season, she had taken up wicketkeeping duties for her state on a full-time basis. That season, she had set a new record for the most number of dismissals by a wicket-keeper in the Women’s National Cricket League.</li><li>She was the leading run-scorer in Australia’s victorious campaign at the 2018 ICC Women’s T20 World Cup with 225 runs in just 5 innings. She was the top run-scorer for Australia in their group stage matches against Pakistan (48 runs), Ireland (56 runs not out), and New Zealand (53 runs); as well as in the semi-final against the West Indies (46 runs). For her consistent performances, she was named the ‘Player of the Tournament’.</li><li>In December 2018, the ICC (International Cricket Council) had honored her with the ‘T20I Player of the Year’ award. She had repeated the feat in 2019. That year, she had also won the Belinda Clark Award, an annual honor that recognizes Australia’s best female international cricketer.</li><li>In October 2019, in a WT20I match against Sri Lanka, she had smoked 148 runs off just 61 balls, including 19 fours and 7 sixes. This was her first century in a WT20I match and was the then highest individual score in the history of WT20Is.</li><li>At the 2020 ICC Women’s T20 World Cup, she was the 2nd-highest run-scorer in the tournament with 236 runs in 6 innings. She was the top run-scorer for Australia in their group stage matches against India (51 runs) and Bangladesh (83 runs). In the match against Bangladesh, she and <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Beth Mooney</a> had recorded an opening partnership of 151 runs. It was the then highest partnership for Australia for any wicket in a WT20I match.</li><li>In the final of the tournament, against India, she had scored a quickfire 75 runs off just 39 balls to lead Australia to a mammoth total of 184 runs and an eventual win by 85 runs. She was named the ‘Player of the Match’ for her performance.</li><li>In September 2020, she had recorded her 92nd dismissal as a wicket-keeper in WT20I matches. She had consequently overtaken legendary Indian captain <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Mahendra Singh Dhoni</a> to set a new record for the most number of dismissals by a wicket-keeper, male or female, in T20I cricket.</li><li>At the 2022 ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup, she had top-scored for Australia in their 2nd group stage match, against Pakistan (72 runs off 79 balls); their semi-final match, against the West Indies (129 runs off 107 balls); and their final match, against England (170 runs off 138 balls). In all 3 of those games, she was named the ‘Player of the Match’.</li><li>For scoring 509 runs in 9 matches in that tournament, the most number of runs scored by an individual in a single edition of the tournament, she was also named the ‘Player of the Tournament’. This was the first time ever that the 500-run mark was breached by a batter in any edition of the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup.</li><li>Her knock of 170 runs in the final of that tournament was the then highest individual score by any batter (male or female) in the final of the ICC Cricket World Cup, surpassing fellow Australian wicket-keeper <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Adam Gilchrist</a>‘s knock of 149 runs against Sri Lanka in the 2007 men’s final. Alyssa’s monumental 170 was also the then second-highest individual score in women’s ODIs for Australia, only behind Belinda Clark’s score of 229 runs not out which she had achieved against Denmark in the 1997 ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup.</li><li>With her efforts against West Indies in the semi-final (129 runs off 107 balls) and England in the final (170 runs off 138 balls), she had also become the first female cricketer to have scored 2 centuries in the knockout stages of the ICC Cricket World Cup. The 170 was also the then highest individual score by a wicket-keeper in women’s ODIs.</li><li>She and her husband Mitchell Starc participate in an annual friendly golf competition that they have affectionately named the Steally Cup by combining their last names (Healy and Starc).</li><p>Featured Image by Alyssa Healy / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jpqjsqujlnqpscClsGg%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./anthony-derosa-youngstown-oh-discover-anthony-derosa-obituary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="anthony derosa Youngstown oh: Discover anthony derosa obituary">&larr;
