She lost 35 pounds last year and she’s partnered with MyFitnessPal and talked about <a href=#>her plan</a> to make smaller fitness goals/resolutions. Most recently, Ayesha appeared on the Rachel Ray Show and talked more about her fitness journey, saying that in the beginning she was trying to compete with her husband and do the same stuff he did to stay fit. But she quickly realized that was obviously untenable.</p><p>Ayesha Curry is opening up about what she’s learned throughout her fitness journey.</p><p>In a recent appearance on the Rachael Ray Show, the chef and cookbook author, 33, discussed how she was finally able to focus on her health after having three children — son Canon, 4, and daughters Ryan, 7, and Riley, 10. However, she said the journey started off rough, admitting that she tried to change her workout routines in order to keep up with her husband, NBA star Stephen Curry.</p><p>“One of the biggest things that was a hindrance was that I was competing — in my own weird, twisted way — with my very athletic husband and thinking I needed to do all of the things that he was doing in order to find my balance and to stay fit,” the mom of three explained.</p><p>“It took me so long to realize, no, my fitness journey and my plan are gonna look how that looks for me. And for me, it’s less high intensity workouts and it’s not doing the diet thing,” Curry continued. “It’s living that 80/20 life and making sure that I’m enjoying life’s celebratory moments and then in between making healthier choices. For me, it couldn’t be so rigid and I found the best results when I kind of loosened up a little bit.”</p><p>Ray then added she can’t — and shouldn’t — feel the need to keep up with her husband.</p><p>“Everyone’s different whether you’re a man or a woman or older or younger, you gotta find the thing that’s right for you,” the daytime star added.</p><p><a href=#>[From People]</a></p><p>I chucked a bit at “my very athletic husband.” That’s understating it a bit — Stephen is a professional athlete. It is literally his job to stay extremely fit. He is compensated for doing so and has the time to do so since it is his job. Of course Ayesha can’t compete. Even without having three kids it’s difficult to compete with that. But I agree with what she says, everyone is different and you have to find what works for you. And that can even vary week to week or day to day. Like Ayesha, I don’t like to diet much, but unlike her I do love a high intensity workout because then that’s less time spent doing it. But I agree with Ayesha that people should enjoy life’s moments and have the slice of cake or whatever. It’s exhausting and thankless to make only healthy choices all the time. And I find the best results when I’m working out for the sake of working out and feeling good versus working out for a particular look, outfit, etc.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmcWhmZ4Z3e8CynKygkZSwtr7RsparnZGhtruxw5iqoZ2PqLWwwcudpa2XpKfGoMDOmJqopaCawaar1qKroZeYmr%2BgtNSsmZqmlKisp7XTp5ysq18%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./best-hotels-in-hydra-telegraph-travel.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Best hotels in Hydra | Telegraph Travel">&larr;
