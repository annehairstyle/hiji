People get tattoos of my face. This is me in a banana split, where I’m the center of a dessert. People made a balloon out of me…very nipply. Quite nipply.”</p><p>He rated various tattoo renditions of himself, many inspired by his character from Jurassic Park.</p><p>One tattoo featured Goldblum’s character in a pizzeria feeding a <a href=# rel=noopener>velociraptor</a>, which he jokingly remarked would be unlikely to take place in the Jurassic Park universe considering how dangerous velociraptors are.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet another was a rendition of a photo of him holding a hot dog from a food truck in Australia, taken from his Instagram, which he fondly remembered.</p><p>He playfully rated some tattoos “10 Goldblums out of 10 Goldblums,” but remarked that all the tattoos deserved a 10 Goldblum rating from him.</p><p>Watch the whole video titled Tattoo Tour below:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Although Goldblum does not have tattoos of his own, he certainly enjoys rating others.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jp2mnqtdn7KnsoygpqWckqHCrnnHmq2eZaSWwbW7zqxm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./elon-musk-delivers-testimony-that-he-is-financially-illiquid.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Elon Musk Delivers Testimony That He Is &amp;quot;Financially Illiquid&amp;quot;">&larr;
