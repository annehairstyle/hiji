On the program 60 Minutes, in January 2006, Miller described the act of skiing “wasted” and compared it to lawlessly driving while intoxicated. Throughout the Olympics, Miller said, “I’m just trying to ski in a way that’s exciting for me.” In an interview shortly after his last race, he said that it had “been an awesome two weeks,” and that he “got to party and socialize at an Olympic level.” After an unapologetic Miller interview with Tom Brokaw, Bob Costas concluded in a primetime editorial that Miller might finally get what he wanted: to be unceremoniously forgotten. Miller received negative coverage in the American and international media; editorials focused on his attitude of simply not caring about the Olympics or about his performance.</p><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Bode Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Skier</strong>.
