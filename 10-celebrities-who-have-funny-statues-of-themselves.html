Not only are stars recognized and adored by millions of people all over the world, but many of them are immortalized&nbsp;through their contributions to the entertainment industry. However, many celebrities are also being immortalized in a very cool and creative way: with statues. That’s right, some of today’s biggest stars have been the subject of some pretty interesting statues, and most recently, a wax figure of rap star, Nicki Minaj, has become the latest to make headlines. The statue, which shows the Nickster&nbsp;copying a pose&nbsp;from her “Anaconda” video has attracted people from all over the place. Apparently, some people will do anything to get close to the statue, and Nicki isn’t the only star with this problem on her hands. Here are 10 celebrities who have funny statues of themselves.</p><p><strong>Kate Moss</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/179463167.jpg alt="Kate Moss The Collection - Photocall" width=641 height=434 sizes="(max-width: 641px) 100vw, 641px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>British model, Kate Moss, has made a name for herself all over the world.Her career has spanned the course of nearly three decades, and she’s become one of the biggest names in the fashion industry. There’s no doubt that her beauty has also inspired others, so it should come as no surprise that Moss has been the subject of a statue. However, this statue probably isn’t what you’re thinking. In 2008, a <a href=#>solid gold </a>statue of Moss was featured at an exhibit in London, and it was definitely a little on the interesting side.</p><p>(Photo by Stuart C. Wilson/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Lucille Ball</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/1325784.jpg alt="Classic shot of Lucile Ball" width=640 height=503 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Lucille Ball spent her entire career making people laugh, so it only makes sense that a statue of the late comedian/actress would do the same. Although <a href=#>this statue </a>may not have intended to be funny, the 400 pound bronze sculpture of Ball is more than a little bizarre. The sculptor, David Poulin, even admitted it that it was some of his most disappointing work. Poulin stated, “in retrospect, it should have never been cast in bronze and made public, and I take complete ownership of that poor decision.”</p><p>(Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Benedict Cumberbatch</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/488767671.jpg alt='Benedict Cumberbatch at "Charles James: Beyond Fashion" Costume Institute Gala - Candids' width=639 height=426 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Lots of people love British actor, Benedict Cumberbatch. In fact, someone loved him so much that they made a life-sized <a href=#>chocolate statue</a> out of the star from the neck up. While Cumberbatch’s face looks pretty accurate, his neck, on the other hand, looks like a large tree trunk. But since the statue is made of chocolate, the bigger the better.</p><p>(Photo by Neilson Barnard/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/450770946.jpg alt="Jennifer Lopez on stage" width=641 height=427 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Over the years, Jennifer Lopez has become one of the biggest names in the entertainment industry. From dancing, to singing, to acting, she’s proven that there is nothing she can’t do. As a result, she’s gained fans all over the world, and someone was so moved&nbsp;by her that they decided to create a wax <a href=#>statue</a>. While it’s definitely an honor for your art to inspire someone else to make their own, the final result probably wasn’t what anyone had in mind. Hopefully this isn’t how whoever made this actually sees J Lo.</p><p>(Photo by Jeff Schear/Getty Images for Kohl’s)</p><p><strong>Tiger Woods</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/491903465.jpg alt="Tiger Woods at Tiger Jam 2014" width=641 height=476 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>There was once a time when Tiger Woods was considered the best golfer in the world. &nbsp;At the height of his career he was so popular that even people who had never watched golf knew who he was. However, after his infidelity was made public, Tiger’s career quickly began to spiral out of control. But although&nbsp;his career has suffered, he is still one of the most recognizable&nbsp;names and faces in golf. But the face on his <a href=#>statue</a> is one you probably won’t recognize. Sure, his personal problems definitely aged him a little prematurely, but whoever made this statue took it a little too far.</p><p>(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Marilyn Monroe</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/1320642.jpg alt="Rare Marilyn Monroe photo" width=639 height=487 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Although it’s been decades since her death, Marilyn Monroe remains one of the most popular names in Hollywood. With that being said, there are lots of statues of the star, and most of them are fantastic – but then, <a href=#>there’s this one</a>. Unfortunately, whoever made this wasn’t able to capture Monroe’s true beauty, but at least the hair is on point.</p><p>(Photo by Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Julia Roberts</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/141496569.jpg alt="Julia Roberts at premiere in Los Angeles" width=642 height=427 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Julia Roberts is one of the most popular actresses in the business, so with that being said you’d think that she’d also have one of the most recognizable faces. However, one sculpture must have completely forgotten what she looks like when he decided to make a <a href=#>statue</a> of the pretty woman, because while it’s not the worst looking thing int he world – it looks absolutely nothing like her. A for effort though!</p><p>(Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images For Relativity Media)</p><p><strong>Princess Diana</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/53318537.jpg alt="Wax Figure of Princess Diana" width=642 height=428 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Princess Diana was one of the most beloved public figures in the world. Her kind heart and philanthropy helped paint a new image of the royal family, and the whole world mourned when she passed away 1997. Since her death, there have been many statues and other pieces of art created in her honor, and most of them have been incredible. Unfortunately; however, one <a href=#>statue</a> in particular has more than a few people scratching their heads. Creative license is one thing, but this is another.</p><p>(Photo by MJ Kim/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Colin Firth</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/151962730.jpg alt="Colin Firth at Somerset House" width=638 height=475 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>For the last 30 years, Colin Firth has been wowing viewers. His role as Fitzwilliam Darcy in the 1995 film, Pride and Prejudice&nbsp;was among his most popular, and has been immortalized thanks to a very interesting <a href=#>statue</a>…in a lake. After seeing this one, you’ll see why lakes aren’t a very popular place to put statues.</p><p>(Photo by Gareth Cattermole/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Nicki Minaj</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/454096862.jpg alt="Nicki Minaj at the MTV VMAs" width=641 height=426 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>When it comes to funny statues, Nicki Minaj’s at Madame Tussauds is currently the most famous. The wax statue of the rapper has gotten way more attention than anyone could have ever imagined, and people just can’t get enough of seeing Minaj in her infamous “Anaconda” pose. However, it looks like people loved the statue a little too much. After a fan got too close, and snapped an “inappropriate” picture, the museum was forced to tighten security.</p><p>(Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</p><p>Lead&nbsp;&nbsp;(Photo by Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for BMI)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGhoaWWTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2KztrrNsmSsrJGpwqa%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./11-things-worth-doing-the-old-fashioned-way-no-matter-how-many-fancy-gadgets-you-own.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="11 Things Worth Doing The Old-Fashioned Way, No Matter How Many Fancy Gadgets You Own">&larr;
