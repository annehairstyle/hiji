Roberson then went home with two of her children, leaving the other two with her mother.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">After her mother was unable to reach her by phone and did not find her at her home, Roberson was reported missing on July 17.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.abcnewsfe.com/a/1c514a65-ec50-48e9-81ba-9636f5f3fa1f/imani-roberson-ht-jt-230805_1691257633809_hpEmbed_4x5.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Investigators searched several homes including the victim's home, a car and cell phones. They found the victim's blood in the home she shared with Anderson and her four kids, Levett said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"Our investigation intensified and it was clear that foul play was evident in the disappearance of Imani," Levett said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">During their investigation, police also found Roberson's car burned.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Levett had said on Saturday that another arrest will be made in this death, but did not identify the suspect at the time.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"We've had about four to five murders this year, and every last one of them has been domestic family violence related," Levett said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">"If there's anyone that's out here that is involved in a toxic relationship, whether you are receiving mental abuse, verbal abuse or physical abuse it is not worth keeping quiet and we need for you to step out and say something so we can end such tragedies like this. Especially tragedies like this that involves children. These are four kids now without a mother and unfortunately now without a father," Levett said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.abcnewsfe.com/a/5ee52b66-a6ee-4ad5-907f-b8760053c965/imani-roberson-presser-parents-03-ht-jt-230805_1691249251272_hpEmbed_16x9.jpg><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk TjIX aGjv">Roberson's four children will be cared for by her parents, Levett said.</p><p class="Ekqk nlgH yuUa lqtk eTIW sUzS">"Last night, my worst fears were confirmed and our family is devastated.
