I know I wouldn’t,” the woman said via <i><a class=body-link href=#>Bloomberg</a></i>.<br></p><p>The Taiwanese firm — which supplies iPhones to US tech firm Apple — said it was “cooperating with the government to organise personnel and vehicles” for employees who want to leave.</p><p>Foxconn has said it faces a “protracted battle” to stamp out the Covid-19 outbreak, but has not said how many of the more than 200,000 staff are affected or in isolation.</p><p>The company has been accused of forcing employees who are unwell to work and not providing medical treatment or timely meals throughout the outbreak.</p><p>And China Labor Watch, a New York-based NGO, has also accused the firm of hiding the number of Covid-19 infections among its employees and forcing sick people to continue working, citing an internal message to staff as well as workers at the factory.</p><p>Foxconn has insisted that it “is making every effort” to ensure its employees are being looked after.</p><p>China is the last major economy committed to a zero-Covid strategy, persisting with snap lockdowns, mass testing and lengthy quarantines in a bid to keep infections down.</p><p>But fast-spreading virus variants have challenged that approach, with outbreaks hitting industries hard in recent months, as virus restrictions disrupt factories and curb consumer spending.</p><p><i><b>Stream your news live & on demand with Flash.
