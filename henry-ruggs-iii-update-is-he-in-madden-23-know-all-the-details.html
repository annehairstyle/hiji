Henry James Ruggs III, who was born on January 24, 1999, is currently a free agent. Ruggs played football during his college years at the University of Alabama, where he was a member of the team that won the 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship. He was picked in the first round of the 2020 NFL Draft by the Raiders. Sadly, during his second season, Ruggs was involved in a car accident that caused the death of a 23-year-old woman. The Raiders released him on the same day.</p><h2>Henry Ruggs III Update: Is Henry Ruggs in Madden 23?</h2><p>The preliminary hearing for Henry Ruggs III, the former player for the Las Vegas Raiders, has been postponed yet again and has now been rescheduled for May, marking the sixth time it has been delayed. It has been more than a year since the tragic accident that resulted in the deaths of Tina Tintor and her dog, Max. According to the police, Ruggs was driving at speeds over 150 mph and was under the influence of alcohol when he collided with Tintor's car at around 3:40 a.m. on November 2, 2021, near Rainbow Boulevard and Spring Valley Parkway. The impact caused both vehicles to catch fire, trapping Tintor and her dog inside, and resulting in their tragic deaths.</p><p>Since Hill's performance, there have been significant changes in the speed ratings. As of August 2022, as expected, Henry Ruggs III is no longer included, and Marquise Brown has fallen a few places. Despite this, Brown still maintains a 97-speed rating. However, there are now two players with a rating of 98 speed, namely Jameson Williams and Quez Watkins.</p><h2>How Long is Henry Ruggs in Jail For?</h2><p>If Ruggs is found guilty, he could face a mandatory two-year sentence and potentially over 50 years in prison. Even if he is not convicted, the chances of him ever playing in the NFL again are highly improbable. His reputation has been severely damaged, and the public backlash would be too significant for any team to consider him.</p><p>Firstly, it's important to mention that Henry Ruggs has been released on bail, but he still faces multiple charges. Ruggs is accused of driving with a blood-alcohol level that was more than twice the legal limit in Nevada, which has resulted in several felony charges against him. In addition, a loaded handgun was reportedly found in his wrecked car, resulting in a misdemeanor gun possession charge.</p><h2>Where is Henry Ruggs Now?</h2><p>According to reports, moments before the crash, Ruggs was driving his car at 156 mph. Additionally, he was accused of having a blood-alcohol level over twice the legal limit in Nevada. As a result, Ruggs was charged with a DUI-related death felony. Although he is not currently imprisoned, his court hearings have been postponed several times. The preliminary hearing, originally scheduled for December 16, 2021, was rescheduled multiple times, including on March 10, May 19, and September 7, 2022, as well as on February 1, 2023.</p><h2>Henry Ruggs Crash</h2><p>In December 2021, the coroner determined that Tina Tintor, the woman who tragically died in a horrific car crash allegedly caused by former Las Vegas Raiders wideout Henry Ruggs III, passed away due to thermal injuries caused by the fire that ensued. Tintor, who was only 23 years old, was driving her Toyota RAV4 when Ruggs allegedly crashed his Corvette, traveling at speeds up to 156 mph. Tintor and her dog Max were unable to escape and perished in the resulting fire. According to the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the Clark County coroner's office released the findings, stating that Tintor's death was accidental and that inhalation of the products of combustion and fractures in several bones, including her nasal bones, right-sided ribs, left forearm, and chest, contributed to her death.</p><a aria-label="twitter url" rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/AldroSport/status/1254716961214300160</a>Expand Tweet<h2>Henry Ruggs Car Accident</h2><p>Prosecutors allege that Henry Ruggs III, the former Las Vegas Raiders wide receiver, was driving his car at 156 mph with a blood alcohol content twice the legal limit in Nevada before crashing into a vehicle that caught fire, resulting in the death of a 23-year-old woman. During his first court appearance, Ruggs, who faces pending felony charges of driving under the influence of alcohol resulting in death and reckless driving, was seated in a wheelchair with a foam brace on his neck and jail guards at his elbows.</p><h2>Henry Ruggs News</h2><p>Henry Ruggs III has currently posted $150,000 bail and is not in jail. However, he is being electronically monitored under the conditions set by a judge. It should be noted that despite posting bail, Ruggs is still facing multiple felony charges, including driving with a blood-alcohol level twice the legal limit in Nevada. In addition, there is a misdemeanor gun possession charge, as the police found a loaded handgun in his car after the crash.</p><p>If convicted, Ruggs could face a mandatory minimum sentence of two years and possibly even more than 50 years. However, even if he is not convicted, it is unlikely that he will be able to resume his career in the NFL. His reputation has been severely tarnished, and the public outcry would make it difficult for any team to consider him.</p><br><br><h2 class=faq_title>Henry Ruggs III Update - FAQs</h2>1.
