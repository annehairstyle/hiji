Dr. Remy was bisexual, and it kept the audience excited as to who she was going to end up with.</p><p>When asked about Thirteen and House’s dynamic, she said that both were stubborn, but he likes things black and white, right and wrong, unlike Remy, who is all about being enigmatic. Although both clashed, there was mutual respect.</p><p>It is the two actors’ chemistry that makes their beloved characters a special part of the show’s charm.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Olivia’s exit&nbsp;</h2><p>In her <a href=# rel=noopener>last episode</a>, called “Charity Case,” where her character, Thirteen, told Dr. House to stop calling her after receiving multiple messages, but he tried explaining to her that he was just to “put the band back together.”</p><p>She teased him that probably what prevented him from visiting her house was an ankle monitor, which Gregory confirmed he was indeed wearing and showed it to her—saying “guilty as charged…literally.”&nbsp;</p><p>The doctor presumed that she met a boy or a girl and fell in love, was happy, and enjoyed whatever little time Thirteen had left. She shared that she indeed met someone, a girlfriend, and then walked away.</p><p>After the scene, the persistent House still called her only to be disappointed and was told that Remy was never coming back to work for him.</p><p>Never say never in life or the world of television, as the Tron actress returned in the show’s season finale in the episodes “Holding On” and “Everybody Dies.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What’s next for Wilde?</h2><p>The proud mother of two is scheduled to release the highly-anticipated film, <a href=# rel=noopener>Don’t Worry Darling</a>, where she directs, produces, and stars opposite her real-life beau, Harry Styles, in September 2022.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCfsmWUnrFuu8uiraKZXay2rbDEZqOemaaaeqm71KycaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./wiki-bio-net-worth-wife-kids.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="wiki, bio, net worth, wife, kids.">&larr;
