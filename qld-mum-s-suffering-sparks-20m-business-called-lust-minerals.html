I believe his journey was a bit more positive. I think for us it was too late as the cancer was in three organs, it was really hard.”</p><p>In September 2014, Ms Hollands launched her brand Lust Minerals by pouring $10,000 worth of savings into it.</p><p>“We launched with a powder first, the formulation a bit different as we added vitamin E to combat drying, a stick cream foundation and matte foundation which is a slightly different formulation and those were the three main products and primer that we still have today,” she said.</p><p>It was slow going for the brand for the first two to three years, she admits, as she had her son but she did manage to get around 82 stockists.</p><p>In 2018, she moved into e-commerce and was using social media influencers to market Lust Minerals.</p><p>Since then the brand has introduced skincare and a make up range with more shades — with a goal to diversify them even more.</p><p>For the 33-year-old, their best-selling product is the Lust Minerals Pro Liquid Foundation with one being sold every two minutes globally.</p><p>Others also include mineral primer and mineral pressed powder foundation and with skincare it’s the AHA exfoliating lotion, the body deodorant and ingestible vegan beauty crystals.</p><p>She is now on track to make $10 million by the end of this financial year, she said, and has achieved a turnover of $20 million since January 2019.</p><p>“I am one of those people who started a brand so young and I was quite naive so of course I thought I could make a brand so big,” she said.</p><p>“It was a good thing for me and has not put a barrier on the goals I can achieve. I feel the sky’s the limit.”</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>Now she has 20 employees and counts one of her biggest wins as a rebrand of the brand’s look which she poured $300,000 into making happen.</p><p>Next up Ms Holland wants to explore the retail space.</p><p>“I am very protective of the brand but open to making the brand in arms reach for our community, so perhaps looking into Sephora and Mecca,” she added.</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Brisbane data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Brisbane</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmny0ucClo2aapai2r7HSrGaqpJRiura50maqrp6Wmr%2BqusZmqqmZoqDAbn6PpmSbraOeu6a%2F0maamqScmrFuuNSsq2almaOys63LrGannaeoerTAzquwaHBoaoClr5ednWmdkWqBdbKSa2lwbmJmhXGDwXJwnpyT</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./rhythmantic-sal-d-amato-video-statistics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="rhythmantic - Sal D'Amato video statistics">&larr;
