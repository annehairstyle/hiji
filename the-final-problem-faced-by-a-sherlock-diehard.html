This may have been the most incredibly crafted episode in the portfolio of brilliance. Cumberbatch never fails to impress but this episode showcased his talents even further. He took us on a journey and a glance into his past caused us to gravitate towards his present self even more. The way he expressed emotions and tension was award worthy. The same goes for Freeman and Gatiss. A round of applause also for Sian Brooke, who’s portrayal of the complicated Eurus Holmes was truly sensational.</p><p>This may have been the most incredibly crafted episode in the portfolio of brilliance.

A round of applause also for Sian Brooke, who’s portrayal of the complicated Eurus Holmes was truly sensational.</p><p></p><p>The episode concluded with the shocking reveal of the secret Holmes’ sister- Eurus, who was the answer to all the problems Sherlock had ever encountered and the reason for who and how he is. The ‘era-defining genius’ had hidden in plain sight throughout the season, posing as different characters. We learn that her incredible mind placed her above normality and we feared her manipulative abilities.</p><p>Credit has to be given for the dark yet intriguing concepts in this episode which explained everything that had happened thus far and connected to every episode so perfectly and beautifully. If you were to watch previous episodes, you would hear Mycroft mention “The East Wind,” a phrase he often used to frighten Sherlock.</p><p>In her youth, Eurus drowned Sherlock’s dearest friend, however, Sherlock associated this tragedy with the loss of a fictitious dog, Redbeard. In doing so, Eurus created the Sherlock we’ve known since Season 1, isolated, reserved and detached, that is until he meets Dr Watson. Of course, we’d always known Watson had created warmth in Sherlock but the realisation that he’d been so cold for so long, for this reason, makes us fall in love with their friendship even more.</p><p>Despite the anxiety her mind controlling abilities may have caused us during the episode, the indifference all seems to fade when we realise how rejected and secluded she has been. Eurus transfers her feelings to Sherlock and the audience in a tremendous metaphorical riddle that truly emphasises the emotions and multiples the empathetic feelings. The episode ends in a clean, conclusive manner, unlike most season finales which have ended in cliffhangers. This could either mean a fresh start in the next series or sadly, this could be the last.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn-static.denofgeek.com/sites/denofgeek/files/styles/main_wide/public/2017/01/sherlock_the_final_problem.jpg width=825 height=464 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>There is much conjecture on which of the above is true. Will there be a fifth season or is the game truly over? Steven Moffatt has said that The Final Problem was intended to neatly wrap up so that if needed, it could serve as a series finale. Co-writer, Mark Gatiss has said ‘The reason we [ended with] Rathbone Place is that, actually, if we do come back – and we would love to come back – we could absolutely very easily start with a knock at the door and Sherlock saying to John ‘Do you want to come out and play?’. They have become the two heroes that we always knew them to be.” Further reassurance that a return is possible is given by Moffatt’s statement in which he stresses that they do not intend for this to be the last season.</p><p><strong>“I think it’s unlikely that we’ve completely finished it. There would be nothing strange in stopping for a while. It could go on forever, coming back now and again.”</strong></p><p>This gives us hope though it also implies we may have a lot of waiting to do. However, this is understandable given the highly demanded cast. Both Martin and Benedict have incredibly busy schedules and creating time to film the show has become rather difficult.</p><p>It’s undeniable that the show could continue for much longer. In terms of romance, it’s looking bright for both Holmes boys. A possible romance has been hinted between Mycroft and Lady Smallwood and the confirmation that ‘The Woman’ is alive and texting Sherlock, opens doors for Irene Adler’s return. All the episodes have been based on the works of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and there are plenty more to possibly adapt and showcase.</p><p>If you missed the latest episode of Sherlock, you can catch up by watching it on BBC iPlayer <a href=#>here</a>.</p><p>Let us know what you thought of the season 4 finale and whether you think Sherlock will be returning by tweeting us @CelebMix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ks6q6wKVkqaqfl7mmuYyfmJydlGLAqbHRpaaco12Ztqa0wKubaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-football-scientist-s-do-not-draft-list-tua-tagovailoa-christian-watson-and-more.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Football Scientists Do Not Draft list: Tua Tagovailoa, Christian Watson and more">&larr;
