One notable change in the re-recorded version was the absence of a particular sentence in the song 'Better Than Revenge'. In the original version, Swift sang, "She's an actress, but she's better known for the things that she does on the mattress." However, in the re-recorded version, the lyrics have been modified to say, "She's an actress, he was a moth to the flame, she was holding the matches."</p><p>'Better Than Revenge' was written by Swift in the aftermath of her breakup with Joe Jonas in 2008. Following their split, Jonas started dating actress Camilla Belle, leading to speculation that the song was inspired by their relationship. With Swift's announcement to re-record her first six albums as a means to regain ownership of her master recordings, fans have been curious to know if she would retain the controversial sentence in the song.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Did 'Barbie' outshine Taylor Swift's â€˜The Eras Tourâ€™ at Golden Globes 2024?

The song was written by Swift following her breakup with John Mayer in 2009. Recently, during one of her surprise performances on the Eras Tour, Taylor performed the song while playing acoustic guitar. Before delving into the song, she took a moment to speak to her fans about how she has evolved and grown since she initially wrote 'Dear John' and the other songs on the album.&nbsp;</p><p>"Iâ€™m 33 years old," she said. "I donâ€™t care about anything that happened to me when I was 19 except the songs I wrote. Iâ€™m not putting this album out so you can go on the Internet and defend me against someone you think I wrote a song about 14 million years ago."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/8087d70f-7a9e-4e8b-8b27-c3b63a2ef3f0.94155509><span class=readpage-disclaimer>This article contains remarks made on the Internet by individual people and organizations.
