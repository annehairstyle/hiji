They told me there was no heartbeat.”</p><p>Struggling to fall pregnant again, Tressa felt as though she was being punished for letting her firstborn go all those years ago.</p><p>Now 23-years-old, the young mother’s despair has turned to joy — after finding out this month that she is expecting with her partner, Darren.</p><p>“I’ll never let this one go,”<a class=body-link href=#> she told The Mirror.</a></p><p>Speaking of the challenge to fall pregnant following the miscarriage, Tressa said “I know it sounds crazy but when I was trying to fall pregnant and it wasn’t happening, I thought the worst.</p><p>“Not having my daughter with me still affects me every single day and I thought I was being punished for what happened with her, for letting her go.</p><p>“Discovering I was pregnant was ­bittersweet. I am so excited about what the future holds and I already love my baby.</p><p>“I cannot wait to meet him or her but when both lines on that pregnancy test showed up, although I was happy, I was desperately sad as well. I had a little cry.”</p><p>Tressa said that if she had the opportunity, she would get her baby girl back in a heartbeat.</p><p>“I am so grateful I am finally going to be the mother I have longed to be all these years,” she said.</p><p>“But I don’t ever want my first child to think I abandoned her, or that I am replacing her with this new baby.</p><p>“I’d welcome her back tomorrow with open arms if I could and I hope she knows she will always be a part of our family.</p><p>“But this is the future for me and I can’t keep looking back. The past has made me even more determined to keep this child and give him or her the best possible life.”</p><p>Following her daughter’s adoption, Tressa spent the following three years in and out of care homes, and fell into a life of alcohol and drug abuse.</p><p>Tressa said she now sees how young she was when she fell pregnant.</p><p>“My little girl is 10 now. She’ll be 11 in the summer almost the same age I was when I fell pregnant,” she said.</p><p>“It has made me realise just how young I was when all that happened. At the time I didn’t feel like I was that young because I had already been through so much but now, it makes me feel sick. No child should have that happen.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb6%2FOpmWarV%2Bhtqex0q2wpZ1fpa6zsc2toKefX6W%2FprPNmqWcsV%2BXv6rAwKKlrGWppMKvs8Ssq2alpaJ6sb7EoKWapqRixKrAx2adopmemLKmeZBpZLKdkafAbq3FrZyrZZiav26yyKuqrWWTnbatsIywmKxlpJa4prqMmq6asV%2Bjsri%2FjKyrqKqpZIZzrZOcaJxrY2eEeYWPcZ1pbWZqfXODkp6ZnZxpl7Km</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./valeria-sizova-survivor-age-height-boyfriend-instagram.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Valeria Sizova Survivor Age, Height, Boyfriend, Instagram">&larr;
