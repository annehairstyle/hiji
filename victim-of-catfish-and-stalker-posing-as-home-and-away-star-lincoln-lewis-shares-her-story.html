I thought, ‘Wow. Okay, why not?’.</p><p>“So I gave him my number.</p><p>“You know, when a nice young man starts paying you compliments and knows, seems to know a lot about you, it’s very flattering.”</p><p>The catfish and Jess began a long-distance relationship conducted entirely online and despite never managing to meet in person the couple communicated exclusively in telephone calls and text messages.</p><p>Jess said the person she was in a relationship with always had “excuses” for why they couldn’t meet up in person.</p><p>“I started to have a few little doubts. The fact that he wouldn’t meet me and, and stuff,” she said.</p><p>“I started to have niggling doubts but I thought why would anyone contact me and, you know, want to lie to me?”</p><p>It got to the stage Jess wanted further proof other than the happy snaps ‘Lincoln’ had sent her, so they had a Skype call.</p><p>“The phone rang and sure enough, here is Lincoln Lewis talking to me,” Jess said.</p><p>“And I just remember seeing him talking. I would say something and there’d be a bit of a delay and then a few minutes later you would see him, like, kind of laughing and throwing his head back ... I was giddy. I was excited.”</p><p>“I was like, ‘Oh my god, this is actually him talking to me’.”</p><p>Abdelmalek had managed to trick Jess into thinking she was speaking with Lincoln Lewis by using software that can take video footage of a person and turn it into a real life scenario.</p><p>But the twisted saga got more confusing when Jess got a call from a colleague who told her Mr Lewis had flown to Brisbane on her flight, despite him telling Jess he was in Sydney.</p><p>“I’ve never known someone who can lie so brilliantly,” Jess said after she’d spoken to fake Lincoln Lewis.</p><p>“The time that they were in the air – where he wouldn’t have been able to have contacted me – was the time that I had been talking to him all morning.</p><p>“And I then confronted him and said ‘You need to tell me who you are’.”</p><p>Jess decided to find out the truth and managed to get in contact with the real Lincoln Lewis only to have her heart broken.</p><p>“He said, ‘Jess, I‘m sorry. I’m sorry that this has happened to you but it’s not me’. He said, ‘it’s never been me’,” Jess recalled.</p><p>“It’s not a person. It’s a disgusting, subhuman creature. No one that’s human could do that to another person. Could be so vindictive and so evil … it’s disgusting.”</p><p>But the nightmare was only just beginning.</p><p>When Jess tried to end her relationship with the catfish posing as the Home And Away actor, she was forced to change her mobile phone number.</p><p>She said within 10 minutes of her changing her number, Abdelmalek contacted Optus to get Jess’s new number and began stalking the single mum.</p><p>Jess was forced to move house twice and changed her daughter’s school but the calls kept coming.</p><p>“I remember one night, I was in the foetal position on my bed. I’d had 50, 60 messages in a row with threats about my daughter,” Jess said.</p><p>“My phone just kept ringing. And I just had the pillow over my head. I was like, ‘just make it stop’.”</p><p>Jess contacted police to help her stop Abdelmalek, who she still believed was a man.</p><p>She offered to collect evidence for the police investigation by secretly recording more of her calls with the catfisher.</p><p>Eventually Jess spun her own ruse to get Abdelmalek to deposit money into her bank account to pay for a new phone, and police were able to make their arrest.</p><p>But the most shocking part was the discovery that Jess’s supposed boyfriend had been a woman masquerading as a man for their whole relationship.</p><p>“For so, for so long, the person that I spoke with, in my mind, 1000 per cent was a man,” Jess said.</p><p>“It was a male.</p><p>“Yeah, it’s hard to convey how I felt at the time … I wanted to vomit.</p><p>“To have that thing staring back at me with this voice, it just made me feel sick to my stomach. It was horrendous.”</p><p>Jess later learnt her friend ‘Emma’ was also one of Abdelmalek’s victims. Sadly, Emma took her own life before Abdelmalek’s trial could begin.</p><p>The catfisher was <span>found guilty of six counts of stalking and initially sentenced to two years and eight months in jail.</span></p><p>“So we were elated, we were so happy, we were, you know, in tears crying,” Jess said.</p><p>“We’d finally stopped it. Because these people won’t stop what they’re doing.</p><p>“They have to be stopped, so that’s what we did.”</p><p>Abdelmalek appealed the ruling in the Victorian County Court in October, but Judge Claire Quin upheld the guilty verdict and increased her sentence to four years in jail.</p><p>Judge Quinn said while the case sounded like something straight out of a television show, it had “significant consequences” for the victims.</p><p>Former Australian Federal Police fraud investigator, Tam McLaughlin, told 60 Minutes that catfishing crimes can be increasingly difficult for police to identify and prosecute.<br></p><p>“In this case, as we saw, the main difficulty is <span>identifying who the actual perpetrator is, and that took years and years of diligent</span><span> detective work to prove in this case,” Mr McLaughlin said.</span></p><p>“We all know what a blood spatter pattern looks like, or we all know what fingerprints on a stolen vehicle look like, but do we all know what the list of IP addresses that might match to a particular iPad or the, what the IME, so the hardware number that attaches to a phone is?</p><p>“And so it’s about having the education within the investigators of those particular technical aspects, you have to undertake the investigation in such a meticulous way as to make sure that you close all of the gates for someone to say, ‘No, that wasn’t me. That was someone else’.”</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>Jess said she still remains heartbroken by the horrifying experience but she’s relieved to finally see justice has been achieved.</p><p>“On the day that it was taken to jail, I felt <span>very strong, I felt very brave and I felt proud because this is something that Emma and I had spoken about, we wanna see this person punished for what they did,” she said.</span></p><p>“Even though I know it’s not my fault, I still can’t help feeling to blame for it happening. So I don’t trust myself with any future relationships or anything like that.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmTDqq%2FToqRmp5ZisKLAxaKqoWWRo7Fuv9Oao6SdomK9sL%2FIp55mmaNitbC5xGaYp5xdlsSixYysq5qqXaG2r6%2FOpaVmpJWstrR50qGYq52jYrWmvoysq6iqqWS7psPSZqqtp6KufKaEl3GanJpkboN2fcVsmW1rYm2yd4SYa2hxcJRshHKu</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-ross-burmingham-celebrity-interview.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Ross burmingham?
