Her dossier of evidence on graphic resources developed by groups with access to schools, who produce materials on such things as “bdsm” and “group sex”, and provide links to online resources that promote “safe” choking, has led Downing Street to announce an independent review.</p><p>Materials like these feed the hyper-sexualisation of children, presenting confusing and sometimes disturbing ideas to impressionable young minds.</p><p>However, we cannot console ourselves if children are only protected <a href=#>in the classroom</a>. Easy access to online pornography is a dangerous and ubiquitous form of “extra-curricular” sex education. A recent study suggested that 44 per cent of boys say they use online pornography to see the “types of sex they wanted to try”. And who do they want to “try” it on? Girls.</p><p>The Children’s Commissioner, Dame Rachel de Souza, highlighted one harrowing account of a young girl who was strangled during her first kiss because her 12-year-old boyfriend had seen it in pornography “and thought it normal”. Neuropsychologists even suggest that strangulation may be the second most common cause of stroke for women under 42.</p><p>This pornification of our culture might have been described as “sexual liberation” at one time. But for whom? Can creating unrealistic male expectations of what women will do, and look like, in the bedroom really be described as liberating? As the 2010 Sexualisation of Young People Review concluded: “As children grow older, exposure to this imagery leads to body surveillance, or the constant monitoring of personal appearance. This monitoring can result in body dissatisfaction, a recognised risk factor for poor self-esteem, depression and eating disorders.”</p><p>Imagine as a young girl that your first exposure to sex is via someone’s smartphone showing extreme pornography. Hardly makes womanhood look like fun does it? Who would want to be the person that these terrifying acts are “done to”?</p><p>Porn is telling girls that female liberation is male domination and pleasure is pain. And the porn industry may be profiting from it, by making money from young people watching porn and even appearing in porn. Accusations made in a New York Times opinion article, “The Children of Pornhub”, triggered Visa and Mastercard to block their credit card users from making a purchase on the site.</p><p>It is clear that we need a watertight regulatory regime to deal with these concerns. This week the <a href=#>Online Safety Bill</a> returns to the Lords for committee, and there is still much work to be done if the Bill is going to protect children properly from online pornography.</p><p>Firstly, mandatory age-verification measures need to be accurate. Lord Bethell has tabled amendments to ensure that systems do not just estimate age, but identify it to the day.</p><p>Secondly, these robust requirements must cover all pornography wherever it is found. The Bill currently creates two different regimes for porn, depending on whether it is user-generated. This risks tech-savvy monopolies playing one off against the other to try to get more of their content to fall within the less stringent regime.</p><p>Finally, age verification needs to be swiftly enforced. Most people would be shocked to know that legislation for age verification was actually passed by Parliament in 2017 but never implemented.</p><p>We cannot allow any further delay. There must be the political will to act and to act now. Ofcom has regulated a limited number of UK-based porn platforms under video-sharing guidance since 2020, as a trial run for the Online Safety Bill. However, despite telling platforms in October 2021 that a self-declaratory tick-box system to confirm age would not pass muster, no action was taken against those who admitted to still using one in summer 2022. Instead, Ofcom seemed to suggest that it would be satisfied as long as a “roadmap” is in place by later this year.</p><p>We need much more ambition than this. Protecting children cannot be left in the hands of those who are sexualising children. It is girls who are paying the highest price.&nbsp;</p><p>Baroness Jenkin is a Conservative peer</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbHLnp6rmaCde6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwfo9ramhoZGR%2FcXvOp6OippVivbC%2BzWagrGWnlr%2Bxtc2gZJqmXZq7tbXRnmSgnZ6av6LAyKilaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./pigcasso-the-famous-pig-painter-who-raised-over-1-million-has-passed-away.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pigcasso, the Famous Pig Painter Who Raised Over $1 Million, Has Passed Away">&larr;
