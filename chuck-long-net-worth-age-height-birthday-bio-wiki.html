In the season of 1982, Hayden Fry said that Long was “destined for greatness”, that was a bold claim given the fact that Long was not a big draw out of high school.&nbsp;Long began in the opening game in the 1981 season however, he was subbed out during a game following an loss to Nebraska.&nbsp;He was brought back to start for the 3rd game in season, and helped lead Iowa to victory against Arizona.&nbsp;Long did not lose his starting spot at Iowa.</p><p>Long was again an all-Big Ten selection as a junior in 1984, as he finished first in the Big Ten in passing efficiency. Long completed 22 consecutive passes against Indiana, setting an NCAA record. He also finished seventh in the Heisman Trophy balloting as a junior. Iowa had a 7–4–1 record after the 1984 regular season and accepted an invitation to the Freedom Bowl against Texas.</p><p>A loss to Ohio State cost Iowa their #1 ranking, but the Hawkeyes still won the Big Ten title outright for the first time in 27 years. Long won many major national awards as a senior, including the 1985 Maxwell Award, given to the nation’s top player and the Davey O’Brien Award, given to the nation’s top quarterback. He was the Big Ten Player of the Year and a consensus first team All-American. Finally, Long was the runner-up for the Heisman Trophy to Bo Jackson of Auburn in the second closest race in the award’s history, losing by just 45 points.</p><p align=justify>After five seasons as a coach for Iowa, Long left the Hawkeyes to become the quarterbacks coach at Oklahoma.&nbsp;Oklahoma Coach Bob Stoops and Long were co-coaches on the Iowa 1982 Rose Bowl team.&nbsp;Long worked as an assistant coach on the Oklahoma team that took home winning the 2000 Bowl Championship Series national championship.&nbsp;He helped coach the quarterback Josh Heupel to a second-place place on the Heisman Trophy voting in the year 2000.</p><p align=justify>Long was redshirted by his team the Iowa Hawkeyes in 1981.&nbsp;But the redshirting requirement was not yet in place, and Long could only get a couple of photos during his redshirt season.&nbsp;The current redshirt policy (2018) allows players to take part in as many as four games in the course of his redshirt season , and also to keep the right to play for a year.&nbsp;Although Long was very sparse during the 1981 season, he was able to run some plays towards the end in the 1982 Rose Bowl; because of this, he was later one of the few College Football Player to ever participate for five games in a bowl.</p><p align=justify>As a sophomore in 1983, Long passed for a school record 345 yards in a 42–35 win at Penn State. A few weeks later, he completed just 12 of 27 passes in a loss to Illinois; it would be the only time in his college career as a starter that he failed to complete at least half of his passes. The following week against Northwestern, Long broke his own school record for passing yards and helped Iowa set a new conference record with 713 yards of total offense. He accounted for 398 yards of total offense, also a school record. By the end of his sophomore year, Long owned Iowa’s school records for yards passing in a season and a career, touchdown passes in a season and a career, and total offense in a season and a career. He led Iowa to a 9–2 record in the 1983 season and a berth in the Gator Bowl after being named first team all-Big Ten.</p><h2>Chuck Long Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Chuck is one of the <strong>richest Former American football player</strong> from United States.
