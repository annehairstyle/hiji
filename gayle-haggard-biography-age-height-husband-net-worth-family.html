The book is the story of her marriage to <a href=#>Ted Haggard</a> and how they survived his infidelity. The book also teaches the fundamental Christian message of forgiveness and restoration while chronicling the events that took place during the three years after the scandal broke.</p><p>In November 2006, Haggard's husband revealed to her that he had engaged in extramarital homosexual activity and drug use. Once this became public the couple were removed from the New Life Church. When Haggard subsequently lost her position as the Director of Women's Ministries due to her husband’s removal from his position as pastor, she told the congregation via a letter written to them, “What I want you to know is that I love my husband, <a href=#>Ted Haggard</a>, with all my heart. I am committed to him until death 'do us part.' We started this journey together and with the grace of God, we will finish together.” She went on to say that she wanted the women of New Life Church to “watch her” as she hoped to prove herself faithful.</p><p>In 2006, Haggard started a new ministry for women at New Life Church called "Women Belong". Her aim was to teach the message of acceptance and love in the body of Christ. Her message of encouragement for women was featured as a chapter in two separate books, Leading Women to the Heart of God (2002) and Free to Soar (2005). Her first full-length book was written to other wives of pastors and was published in 2004, entitled, A Life Embraced, A Hopeful Guide for the Pastor’s Wife.</p><p>Haggard and her husband founded New Life Church in Colorado Springs, in 1985, with meetings in the basement of their home. The church grew to 14,000 members by 2006, with a large campus on the north side of Colorado Springs, Colorado.</p><p>Gayle M. Haggard (born April 8, 1957) is an author, speaker and the wife of American evangelical preacher <a href=#>Ted Haggard</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfnK66uMRmn5qfl5a%2FpQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./gena-lee-nolin.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Gena Lee Nolin">&larr;
