Ray and Judy Nunn and Norman Coburn among others sat down together and did a group negotiation and had (Seven) over a barrel."</p><p>Others in TV's $500,000 plus a year club include Nine's morning show host Kerri-Anne Kennerley and breakfast show hosts Lisa Wilkinson and Karl Stefanovic (Nine) and Melissa Doyle and David Koch (Seven).</p><p>While the commercial networks refused to confirm the sums being dished out to their key stars, Watercooler Talent's David Wilson said many on-air presenters and actors were achieving six figures.</p><p>"There's a lot of on-camera people on television and they come in tiers," Wilson, who represents Idol's Ian "Dicko" Dickson among others, said.</p><p>"And, yes, that middle band in which they earn six figures is certainly the most populated."</p><p>While Wilson refused to comment on Dickson's wage for the four months he works on the Network Ten talent show, another leading agent - who declined to be named - said Idol's key talent earned between $300,000 and $350,000.</p><p>"Andrew G makes the lesser end of that mark but the judges are all sitting around the 350 (thousand) mark," the agent said.</p><p>He also refuted claims dumped Idol judge Kyle Sandilands was making $1 million a year on the program, as was heavily reported at the time of his axing.</p><p>"I would always question that that ever existed," he said. "I just don't believe that figure to be possible out of that program.</p><p>"If you're paying a million a year for Kyle you need your head read."</p><p>One who is most certainly making millions, however, is Rove.</p><p>"With him it really is like asking how long is a ball of string?" said another leading agent.</p><p>"As talent alone, that is, fronting Rove, he's said to be making a million. And then you have to factor in his role as EP and producing his various other projects."</p><p>Another big earner is Rebecca Gibney, star of Packed To The Rafters on $500,000. Relative newcomers Sonia Kruger (Dancing With The Stars), Natalie Bassingthwaighte (So You Think You Can Dance) and actresses Jessica Marais (Rafters) and Jodi Gordon (Home And Away) are lagging behind.</p><p>"Sure, they're not making what Gibney does, which is about 500K a year, but she's been around a long time and has a massive following," the agent said.</p><p>"Sonia makes about $350,000 a season, Nat gets 200K for Dance, while Jess and Jodi would all sit around the $3500 to $5000 a week for their work."</p><p>Marais is believed to earn up to $140,000 a year for Rafters, while Gordon's turn on the Seven soap nets her between $160,000 and $230,000.</p><p>Mr Wilson said that not all on-air personalities are rolling in cash.</p><p>"I know a lot of people on weekly programs who are in the five-figure bracket," Wilson said.</p><p>While MasterChef proved the year's smash hit, one agent said the program's judges - George Calombaris, Gary Mehigan and Matt Preston - and host Sarah Wilson remained on relatively small industry salaries.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmSypbDInmSmm5eqtrOxjKumr51dorCurc2uqmasn6V6tcLSZqmim5hiuaq%2F02ilnq%2BjYsC1u9GyZmxxkZaucq%2BUnmxrm5RqfqOCkGubnG6Va696r8Geappo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./emanuel-ungaro-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Emanuel Ungaro Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr;
