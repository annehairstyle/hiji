Unfortunately, this pressure to be thin is all the more powerful in the extremely weight conscious entertainment industry. &nbsp;Over the years, it has become increasingly common for celebrities to publicly struggle with their weight, often going back and forth between gains and losses. &nbsp;While it is no secret that Hollywood prefers thin frames, some stars&nbsp;have taken things too far. &nbsp;Here are 10 celebrities who are way too skinny.</p><p>(Photo by Kris Connor/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/145857681.jpg alt="2012 CMT Music Awards - Show" width=640 height=425 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>10. Denise Richards</strong></p><p>Over the last several years, actress/model Denise Richards has appeared to be thinner than ever. &nbsp;Although naturally slim, the 44 year-old mother of three has been photographed looking nearly emaciated. &nbsp;However, Richards has fought back against claims that she may have an eating disorder stating: “I don’t know why lately I’ve been getting so much flack for it.&nbsp;I have a very healthy lifestyle and I’m busy.”</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/52798296.jpg alt="Michael Jackson Trial Continues" width=641 height=538 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>9. Macaulay Culkin</strong></p><p>Since his days as a child star, actor Macaulay Culkin has remained relatively low-key. &nbsp;In his public appearances over the last several years, Culkin has been extremely&nbsp;thin. &nbsp;In 2012, Culkin’s father&nbsp;believed his son’s weight loss was a result of a drug addiction. Soon after the allegations, Culkin appeared to have gained weight; however, even with a few extra pounds he is still painfully skinny.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/454659332.jpg alt="Lexus Design Disrupted: Gareth Pugh - Arrivals - MADE Fashion Spring 2015" width=640 height=426 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>8. Sarah Jessica Parker</strong></p><p>Sarah Jessica Parker has always been thin; however, several years ago she seemed to be losing weight that simply was not there to lose. &nbsp;In several photographs, Parker’s upper-body looked like the result of dieting and exercise gone way too far.</p><p>(Photo by Mireya Acierto/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/453946254.jpg alt='Premiere Of The Asylum & Fathom Events&#39; "Sharknado 2: The Second One" - After Party' width=639 height=431 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>7. Tara Reid</strong></p><p>Unfortunately, Tara Reid’s body image has taken a lot of hits over the course of her career. &nbsp;After undergoing a plastic surgery procedure that did not go as planned, Reid’s stomach was left disfigured and scarred. &nbsp;However, botched plastic surgery aside, Reid has also received a lot of criticism for her skeleton-like appearance. &nbsp;After seeing photos of her practically non-existent stomach, both fans and media outlets alike began to question her health. &nbsp;However, Reid insists that her weight is a result of genetics. &nbsp;During an interview she stated: “I laugh when people say I starve myself, it’s almost ridiculous, I love food. Being thin is in my genetics, it’s not my fault I’m this size.&nbsp;&nbsp;have a really fast metabolism. People get mad that I’m so thin but there’s nothing I can do about it. My weight hasn’t fluctuated in years!”</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Angela Weiss/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/151634618.jpg alt="Victoria Beckham - Presentation - Spring 2013 Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week" width=641 height=496 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>6. Victoria Beckham</strong></p><p>Over the last several years, former&nbsp;Spice Girl Victoria Beckham has received a lot of negative attention for her weight – or lack thereof. &nbsp;According to singer – and Beckham’s former friend – Cheryl Cole she received this answer when she asked Beckham about her weight: “When they say, I’m too thin, I just think: “You know what? I’m happy to be thin. I’m into fashion and I like being able to wear whatever I like. It’s my business, and if other people don’t like it, that’s their business.”</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Peter Michael Dills/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/488755797.jpg alt='"Charles James: Beyond Fashion" Costume Institute Gala - Candids' width=640 height=441 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>5. Nicole Richie</strong></p><p>In 2014, news began to circulate that reality TV star Nicole Richie may have reached an unhealthy weight. &nbsp;Several sources close to Richie revealed that were worried about her health, noting she had not been eating properly. &nbsp;After the allegations, Richie told the media that she was not suffering from any sort of eating disorder; however, she has continued to lose weight.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/84751777.jpg alt='"The Real Housewives Of New York City" Season 2 Premiere Party' width=640 height=426 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>4. Bethenny Frankel</strong></p><p>For the last two years, Bethenny Frankel’s weight has been the topic of many conversations. As the founder of the Skinnygirl Cocktail line, it is no surprise that Frankel is, well, a skinny girl. But, how skinny is too skinny? However, after posting a picture in which she looked extremely thin, many of her fans expressed concerns about her health. &nbsp;One fan commented: “It hurts your fans to see you like this. We love you and we want you to be healthy.” However, amid&nbsp;reports that her weight has reached an all-time low (literally), Frankel has spoken out against the claims. &nbsp;&nbsp;During an interview, Frankel asked:”Do I look like I need to eat a burger?” Unfortunately, the answer is yes; several.</p><p>(Photo by Gary Gershoff/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/452732336.jpg alt="OCRF's 17th Annual Super Saturday Hosted By Kelly Ripa And Donna Karan" width=640 height=425 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>3. Kelly Ripa</strong></p><p>The camera may add 10 pounds, but Kelly Ripa, co-host of&nbsp;<i>Live! with Kelly and Michael,&nbsp;</i>has been looking like she could stand to gain another 10. &nbsp;In 2014, photos began to circulate of Ripa’s “beach body;” however, fans seemed to be unimpressed with what they thought was an unhealthy appearance.</p><p>(Photo by Mike Coppola/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/153871786.jpg alt="56th BFI London Film Festival Opening Film: Frankenweenie" width=640 height=410 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>2. Antonia Campbell-Hughes</strong></p><p>In 2012, Irish actress Antonio Campbell Hughes made headlines when she dropped to an astonishing low 80 pounds. &nbsp;Although Campell-Hughes’ weight loss was attributed to her role in the 2013 film, 3096, many began to wonder how far is too far when losing weight for a role. &nbsp;Campell-Hughes may have thought she was staying true to her art form; however, others saw it as a promotion for harmful body image issues.</p><p>(Photo by Eamonn McCormack/Getty Images)</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/455955672.jpg alt="Guiliana Rancic Hosts Westfield Spring/Summer Campaign" width=640 height=426 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>1. Guiliana Rancic</strong></p><p>E! Network anchor, Guilana Rancic, is no stranger to criticism in regards to her weight. &nbsp;Over the years, Rancic’s thin frame has caused people to question the state of her health. &nbsp;In recent public appearances, Rancic has been “shockingly skinny” leading some to believe that she may currently weight less than 100 pounds. &nbsp;After pictures of Rancic on the red carpet for the 2015 Grammys began to circulate, many fans commented that she looked sick.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Don Arnold/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGhoaWWTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2LEosWMrKKipp6ufA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./2021-musical-drama-starring-andrew-garfield-as-real-life-composer-jonathan-larson-3-wds.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="2021 musical drama starring Andrew Garfield as real-life composer Jonathan Larson: 3 wds.">&larr;
