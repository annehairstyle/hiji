She is a published writer and golf broadcaster.</p><p>Baugh was born in Gainesville, Florida. Her father Hale Baugh, a lawyer who competed at the 1948 Summer Olympics as a modern pentathlete, was a very good amateur golfer, who introduced his children to golf at early ages. She won the National PeeWee Golf Championship five times, her first coming at age three. Her parents divorced when she was 11 years old, and she moved with her mother from their Florida home to Long Beach, California. Lacking the money to pay green fees, she and friends would sneak onto golf courses to play. At age 14 she won her first of two straight Los Angeles Women's City Golf Championships. Her older brother Beau Baugh played professionally for a time. She graduated from high school at the age of 16 with excellent grades. She studied at Long Beach City College and California State University, Long Beach.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfoa62vsBmmZqtl50%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./lee-evans.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lee Evans">&larr;
