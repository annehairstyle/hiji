They also don’t know if the laser was attached to a gun, but they believed it was. A Pacers security guard in the loading area at the time remarked: “That’s 100 percent a gun.”</p><p>“We felt we were in grave danger,” one person who was present said. The two sources who spoke to The Athletic requested anonymity because they fear retribution from those who confronted them. They said they considered filing a report with police but decided against it for the same reason.</p><p>The Pacers did alert the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>NBA</a>, and league spokesperson Mike Bass told The Athletic that the league probed the matter.</p><p>“NBA Security and league investigators conducted an investigation interviewing numerous eyewitnesses and reviewing video surveillance following allegations made by the Indiana Pacers organization regarding a postgame incident on Jan. 29. While we substantiated that a postgame situation arose that was confrontational, based on interviews and other evidence gathered, we could not corroborate that any individual threatened others with a weapon,” Bass said. “Certain individuals involved in the postgame situation and a related matter during the game that night have been subsequently banned from attending games in the arena. If additional information becomes available related to the postgame situation, the league office will conduct a further review.”</p><p>The Athletic contacted the Grizzlies on Sunday requesting comment from the team and Morant. A spokesperson responded that the team “complied completely with the league’s investigation and are abiding by its findings” and declined further comment.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/app/uploads/2023/02/05125637/USATSI_19886952-scaled.jpg alt width=2560 height=1706 sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class=table-cell-span></span> <span class=credits-text>(Photo: Petre Thomas / USA Today)</span><p>During the Jan. 29 game, several Pacers and Grizzlies team members verbally sparred and Morant’s father, Tee, and one of Morant’s longtime friends, Davonte Pack, also directed comments at Pacers players.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>In the third quarter, Pack walked onto the court and directed expletives at multiple Pacers players. A game referee interceded, called arena security, and Pack was removed from the floor.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Ja Morant and Andrew Nembhard got into it and eventually James Johnson got involved. Looks like Ja Morant’s friend Davonte Pack was escorted off the floor. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/etvu1yIXHZ</a></p><p>— Damichael Cole (@DamichaelC) <a href=#>January 30, 2023</a></p><p>After the game, the Pacers players, coaches and support staff entered the loading area to board a team bus. About 30 to 40 yards away from the bus were two parked cars. Pack and four to five other men emerged from the cars, walked to within 30 feet of the Pacers group and began shouting at them.</p><p>According to the sources, the remarks directed at them by Pack and others included: “Come get some of this” and “you don’t know how we roll” and “I’ll show you what I got.” Some Pacers players and others yelled back at them, according to the two people present. Pacers, NBA and arena security got between the two groups.</p><p>The verbal sparring continued intermittently for approximately 15 to 20 minutes, until Morant entered the loading area. He, Pack and the others dispersed into two vehicles. Morant, Pack and one other person got into an SUV, sources said. The first vehicle turned toward the bus before exiting up a ramp and out of the arena’s loading area. The SUV moved toward the Pacers bus, turned, slowed, and that was when members of the Pacers traveling party noticed a red laser coming from the car and being trained on players, coaches and others.</p><p><span>Pack could not be reached for comment.</span></p><p><span>Grizzlies coach Taylor Jenkins said before Sunday’s game against the Raptors — for which Morant was ruled out because of wrist soreness — that the incident was “addressed internally” and that the team was “fully compliant” with the NBA’s investigation.</span></p><p>(Top photo: Justin Ford / Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57k2pscGpoaXxzfJFsZmlqX2WCcLzAnJyrq12cv6rG2aWgnqtdoa60sdFmoZplnaS%2ForrTZqCnrpWowaqzwK2gqKZf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nene-leakes-is-reportedly-the-first-black-woman-to-own-a-business-inside-mgm-national-harbor-see.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="NeNe Leakes Is Reportedly The First Black Woman To Own A Business Inside MGM National Harbor  See">&larr;
