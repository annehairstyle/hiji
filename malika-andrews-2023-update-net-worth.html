Early Life, Education, & Parents</h2><p>Malika Andrews was born on<strong> January 28, 1995</strong>, in Oakland, California (U.S.). However, her parents’ name is not disclosed at the moment, but she has a younger sister named Kendra Andrews.</p><p>Also, as a native of California, she holds American citizenship and belongs to the African-American ethnicity.</p><p>Likewise, Andrews’ mother is a white woman, whereas her Father is of <strong>black ethnicity.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/malika-1316.jpg><p>Moreover, Malika comes under Aquarius’s horoscope and, as such, is an independent woman, has a friendly, outgoing nature, and is progressive-minded.</p><p>Andrews grew up as a fan of the <strong>Golden State Warriors</strong>. While Malika was in 8th grade, she was kicked out of Head Royce School due to an eating disorder.</p><p>Later she attended a<strong> therapeutic boarding school</strong> in Utah. After graduating, the Californian participated at the University of Portland.</p><p>Malika earned a bachelor of arts degree and graduated with honors in 2017. At the same time, she served as a chief editor for the student newspaper called <strong>The Beacon</strong>.</p><p>She also won a <strong>National Association of Black Journalists scholarship</strong> and trained with the Sports Journalism Institute.</p><h2>How old is ESPN Malika Andrews? Age, Height, & Body Measurements</h2><p>Born in <strong>1995</strong>, Malika &nbsp;28 is years old.</p><p>In addition, being a new face in the journalism field, the <strong>Californian shows</strong> such maturity and confidence while reporting in front of a camera, which makes you think, is she a newbie?</p><p>Even though it is not confirmed data, Malika looks about <strong>5’7″ (1.73 m)</strong> tall and has a lean body figure.</p><p>Undoubtedly, having to appear on the screen almost all the time, the American made sure she looked presentable.</p><p>In addition, Andrews’ style is particularly unique and sets her apart from most of her co-workers.</p><p>In the same way, recently, the <strong>NBA reporter</strong> went with an afro-style hairdo, which is dark brown.</p><p>While her body measurements are still dark, various pictures from Instagram suggest she has a slim and toned physique.</p><p>Most importantly, Malika is distinguishable through her afro-bun hairdo, black eyes, and round face.</p><h2>Malika Andrews | Career: NBA Reporter</h2><p>With an ambition to break into the journalism world, the Californian strived in college with an excellent repertoire of achievements.</p><p>Eventually, ESPN would knock on her door after graduation&nbsp;with a job offer.</p><p>In late 2018, Andrews joined ESPN to work mainly as a sideline reporter assigned to cover <strong>Milwaukee Bucks, </strong><strong>Minnesota Timberwolves</strong>, and <strong>Chicago Bulls</strong>.</p><p>Moreover, the Journalist keenly attended other NBA games and prepared a report on her findings.</p><p>Although Malika is currently finding success with the ESPN network, her initial breakthrough came with a short service at the Chicago Tribune.</p><p>In like manner, the Oakland native also assisted <strong>James Reston</strong> of The New York Times with research.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/malika-1317.jpg><p>Notwithstanding that, Andrews had the opportunity to explore news beyond the sporting field as well.</p><p>Most notably, the network tasked her and several other journalists to dig up the incident between <strong>Donald Trump</strong> and <strong>Stormi Daniels.</strong></p><p>Similarly, Malika made an impactful coverage, in 2017, of wildfires that plagued Sonoma County, which in turn had adverse effects on Equine industries.</p><p>Further, if we venture into sports, the Oakland native received the opportunity to sit down with <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Khris Middleton</strong></a> and <strong>Lonzo Ball</strong> to discuss all things NBA.</p><p>You might also want to read: <strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&lt;&lt;Suzy Kolber Bio: Age, Height, Family, ESPN, Net Worth, Instagram Wiki >></a></strong></p><h2>How much money does Malika Andrews make? Net Worth, Salary & Income</h2><p>It is hard to pinpoint Malika’s net worth, but according to estimations, it is in the million-dollar range. Likewise, a reporter at ESPN receives an average salary of <strong>$50k</strong> yearly.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/malika-1315.jpg><p>In contrast to the highest earners at ESPN, public broadcaster wages range from<strong> $18.8k</strong> to <strong>$75.7k</strong> annually.</p><p>Despite not being amongst the highest-earning reports on the network, Andrews is making her way there, step by step.</p><p>Recently, as women voiced the necessity of equal pay throughout the U.S. and worldwide, the discrepancy between a man’s and a woman’s salaries is reducing.</p><p>A lot is yet to stabilize, but Californians will have significant earnings.</p><h2>Who is Malika Andrews’s Fiancee? Relationship Status and Dating</h2><p>To begin with, much like her childhood, Malika’s romantic life is anything but an open book. It may be that the NBA reporter is seeing someone but maintains privacy about the matter.</p><p>On the other hand, this can be nothing but speculation. A budding Journalist such as Andrews would be more career-oriented than seeking to be in a relationship.</p><p>Although there were rumors that Malika was married and pregnant, these rumors were nothing but a hoax.</p><p>Likewise, there is also absolutely no news regarding Andrews’s past affairs or ex-boyfriends.</p><p>Hence, we just need to settle for the fact that she is single and focused on building a successful career.</p><p>But, we hope Malika will soon find someone to spend her life with for years.</p><h2>Social Media Presence:</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>: 456K&nbsp;followers</p><h2>Some FAQs:</h2><h3>Is Malika Andrews a black Journalist?</h3><p>Malika Andrews is ESPN’s only Black female NBA reporter.
