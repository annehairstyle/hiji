The two decided to form a musical duo and by the age of 20 had already found success.</p><p>The duo became the first Western pop act to play in China, had a slew of No. 1 hits and achieved global success. They played their last gig at Wembley Stadium in June 1986.</p><p>The “Careless Whisper” singer realized he was gay or at the very least bisexual at the age of 19.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">Michael and Andrew Ridgeley met in school and formed Wham! while still teenagers. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">Wham! sold more than 30 million records in the ’80s. <span class=credit>Redferns</span></figure><p>“I had stayed over at this guy’s house,” he revealed in an interview played in the documentary. “He’d tried to have sex with me but I’d been too scared, but I realized I wanted to stay in the bed for the night. I realized I wanted to be close to this guy, which had never happened before.”</p><p>Michael went to tell his best friend, Ridgeley, who only “wanted him to be happy” but advised Michael not to come out to his family, especially his father, a tough Greek Cypriot immigrant.</p><p>“That is a pivotal moment,” Michael said. “At that point in time, I really did want to come out, and then I lost my nerve completely.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-full">Michael admitted he didn’t realize how much he would sacrifice by staying in the closet. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Michael went on to have a hugely successful solo career. <span class=credit>Getty Images</span></figure><p>As Wham!’s success continued, the singer felt more and more trapped.</p><p>“I had this little voice inside going, ‘What am I going to do?'” he recalled. “I was intelligent enough to know that this was the wrong road if I was looking for happiness. I should not be trying to catch up with Michael Jackson or Madonna, which is what I was absolutely intent on doing. I wanted to be able to develop as a human being but I felt trapped.”</p><p><strong>For more Page Six you love …</strong></p><p>The “Freedom!” singer admitted that he “was too young and too immature to know that I was sacrificing as much as I was.”</p><p>Michael went on to have a hugely successful solo career and finally came out to his parents after<a href=#> his true love, Brazilian dress designer and stylist Anselmo Feleppa</a>, died of AIDS in 1993. He penned an emotional four-page letter, which did not surprise his always-supportive mother. Unfortunately, his father did not take the news so well.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Michael (pictured here in 2011) died at age 53 in 2016. <span class=credit>FilmMagic</span></figure><p>In his later years, the Grammy winner repeatedly fell for porn stars and <a href=#>developed a serious drug problem</a>.</p><p>He <a href=#>died on Christmas Day 2016</a> at the age of 53 from liver disease and heart failure.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Wham!” begins streaming</a> on July 5.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiokZyytLXXZ5qopV9nfXN%2FjmltaGlpZLSmu9GgnGalmZi1orHLZpuemaSderCyjLCfmqVdrK60ecGempqto5p6qnnWmqpmm5ykwKbAxJ1kmqaUYrqqv8SrmJuklWQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./when-conor-mcgregor-accused-informant-ali-abdelaziz-of-a-controversial-past-in-fiery-monologue.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="When Conor McGregor accused informant Ali Abdelaziz of a controversial past in fiery monologue">&larr;
