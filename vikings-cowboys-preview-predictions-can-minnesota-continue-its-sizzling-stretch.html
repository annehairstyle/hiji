And their most recent game captivated the collective <a class=ath_autolink href=#>NFL</a> viewing audience. How about that for a start for the new regime, led by first-year general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah and coach Kevin O’Connell?</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>That said, a half-season of regular-season games remains. The matchups do not get easier, as evidenced by who is traveling to U.S. Bank Stadium this Sunday: the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Dallas Cowboys</a>.</p><p>They are formidable. They pose numerous challenges. In advance of Sunday’s game, The Athletic’s&nbsp;<a href=#>Alec Lewis</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=#>Jon Krawczynski</a> assess how the two teams stack up:</p><h2>What I’m watching</h2><p><strong>Lewis:</strong> <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Justin Jefferson</a>. Call me Captain Obvious, if you please. But after Sunday’s absurdity, how could I pick anything else? He’s on pace for 130 catches and 2,002 receiving yards. He has the most contested catches (14) in the NFL, per PFF. He snagged an important third-down grab a few weeks ago against <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Arizona</a>. He followed that up with multiple impressive catches against the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Commanders</a>. And his performance in Buffalo? Nothing more needs to be said. What’s next? How can he top it? It’s hard to imagine that possibility. But this is a 23-year-old who has pushed the boundaries of possibility. He’s a must-watch every week.</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>Why Justin Jefferson's ridiculous catch and huge numbers this season&nbsp;come down to trust</p></a><p><strong>Krawczynski:</strong> <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Patrick Peterson</a> turning back the clock. The guy is 32 years old, the time when cornerbacks typically move to safety or retirement. But Peterson just keeps coming up with big plays when this bend-but-don’t-break defense needs them the most. He is playing with supreme confidence, and that is trickling down to the rest of the unit. It may not be the Purple People Eaters or the Millard-Doleman-Studwell crew that dominated in the late ’80s, but the defense is improving every week and starting to find itself. Peterson is a big part of that, and the Vikings will need him again on Sunday against CeeDee Lamb and the Cowboys.</p><h2>Biggest concerns</h2><p><strong>Lewis:</strong> The Cowboys pass rush. In recent weeks, the Vikings have faced a couple of high-end fronts. Washington and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Buffalo</a> rank among the top 10 teams in pressure rate. The Cowboys, though, rank No. 1. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Micah Parsons</a> is a menace. Demarcus Lawrence is destructive. The front, in its entirety, is fierce. Add in Dallas defensive coordinator Dan Quinn’s increased willingness to throw the kitchen sink at offensive protections and alter coverage on the back end, and the Vikings offense should have a true challenge Sunday.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p><strong>Krawczynski:</strong> What does Vegas know? Every once in a while, the oddsmakers put a line out there that really makes you scratch your head. Why would the Cowboys (6-3) be favored in a road game against an 8-1 team coming off such an impressive victory? Is it the Vikings’ injury concerns? Disbelief in <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Kirk Cousins</a>? Are they just trying to spur more action on the game? It’s hard to say, but what I can say is that the oddsmakers usually don’t miss by much. This game seems like a slam dunk. In the NFL, maybe that should be the biggest worry of them all.</p><h2>Biggest opportunities</h2><p><strong>Lewis:</strong> <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Dalvin Cook</a> and <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Alexander Mattison</a>. Only three NFL defenses have been worse against the run, per TruMedia’s expected points added statistic, than the Cowboys over the past two games. Last week, for example, the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Packers</a> ran for 207 yards on 39 carries against the Cowboys. The Packers relied heavily on their outside-zone run concepts but were also able to gash the interior of the Cowboys defense. The week before, the <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Bears</a> leaned heavily on inside-zone run concepts. The Vikings’ scheme is full of each strategy, which should bode well for a running back group and an offensive line that have been underrated this season.</p><p><strong>Krawczynski:</strong> <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Blake Brandel</a> (if <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Christian Darrisaw</a> is unable to play). Darrisaw was still in the concussion protocol as of Thursday, O’Connell said. So it remains to be seen if he will be cleared in time for Sunday. The Vikings’ 2020 sixth-round pick stepped into a tight spot in Buffalo when Darrisaw went out, matching up against <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Von Miller</a> at a time in the game when the Bills were pinning their ears back and rushing the passer. Brandel filled in admirably, giving Cousins enough time to engineer an incredible comeback. If he has to step in again this week, he will be seeing a lot of Parsons, maybe the best defensive player in the league. Play well this week in one of the league’s spotlight games, and it portends for a bright future in this league.</p><h2>Most interesting storyline</h2><p><strong>Lewis:</strong> Can the Vikings snag the No. 1 seed? The <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Eagles</a> lost on Monday night and now have the same record as the Vikings — with the tiebreaker, of course. A win Sunday against the Cowboys would further the Vikings’ chances at cementing not only home-field advantage but also a potential bye. Though the Vikings have a sizable lead in the NFC North, the value of the No. 1 seed cannot be overstated, and it’s within reach for the Vikings. A win would keep it that way.</p><p><strong>Krawczynski:</strong> These two quarterbacks have been the same guy for a long time. <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Dak Prescott</a> has gotten more shine because of the star on his helmet, but statistically and from a winning perspective, they are two players who have piled up the yards and the stats without getting their teams over the hump in the playoffs. Cousins has been more durable than Prescott. Other than that, there isn’t much difference between them. Both are looking for that breakthrough season from a team-success standpoint. It will be interesting to see who plays better Sunday.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><h2>Quote of the week</h2><p>“I have one of the best neighbors in the world on our street,” Kirk Cousins said this week. “I was getting bodywork in my house on Monday night, and I look over, and he’s shoveling (snow) from my back patio. When they talk about ‘Minnesota nice,’ I live that on a daily basis with my neighbors.”</p><h2>Stat of the week</h2><p><strong>5:</strong> Dalvin Cook has scored at least one touchdown in five consecutive games, the longest such streak in the NFL this season.</p><h2>Predictions</h2><p><strong>Lewis:</strong> 34-23, Vikings. After last week’s performance (and Jon’s willingness to roll with the team that has gutted through many a game), I have made a decision: I’m not going against them until they provide me a convincing reason to do so. Prescott is going to stress the Vikings defense, and Parsons is going to get his. But the Vikings have Jefferson. And that will be enough.</p><p><strong>Krawczynski:</strong> 30-24, Vikings. We’ve talked a lot this season about wanting to see the Vikings prove it against quality competition. They’ve been saying that for the Cowboys since the Aikman-Emmitt-Irvin days ended. It seems like every season the Cowboys are hyped as some super-talented group. Every season they prove to be overrated. So I’ll believe it when I see it. And maybe after Sunday, I will believe it. But they have to show me something first. These guys couldn’t cover <a class=ath_autolink href=#>Christian Watson</a>. What are they going to do with Jefferson?</p><p>2022 Vikings week-by-week predictions</p><table class="in-article table border-transparent-imp in-article-striped in-article-no-column-border-right in-article-no-column-border-left"><tr><th class="user-select-none relative nowrap-imp"><span class=left>Game</span></th><th class="user-select-none relative nowrap-imp"><span class=left>Week 11 vs. DAL</span></th><th class="user-select-none relative nowrap-imp"><span class=left>Record</span></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p><span>Lewis</span></p></td><td class="ia-hlt team relative"></td><td><p><span>7-2</span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p><span>Krawczynski</span></p></td><td class="ia-hlt team relative"></td><td><p><span>8-1</span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>NFL Week 11 expert picks and odds for Vikings vs. Cowboys, Chiefs vs. Chargers and every other game</p></a><p>(Photo of Dalvin Cook: Isaiah Vazquez / Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57knJncmhia3xzfJFrZmppX2aFcK%2FOsJmosaNiw6q3yKeerGWgp7K3tcSwZKmqlZm2pMDIqKWsZZqas6ex0aymp2WTpLysew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-a-jelly-donut-doesn-t-have-in-the-middle.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What a jelly donut doesn't have in the middle">&larr;
