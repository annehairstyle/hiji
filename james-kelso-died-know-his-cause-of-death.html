We bonded early. I worked for him on various construction jobs he took on outside of school, hung out at his house listening to jazz, and was his student assistant during my senior year. He helped me get a band scholarship at Tulsa U, his own alma mater, where I first studied art. I can’t thank him enough for recognizing who I was and encouraging me to fearlessly travel the path I chose. Years later, we always met as fellow travelers when our schedules allowed.
