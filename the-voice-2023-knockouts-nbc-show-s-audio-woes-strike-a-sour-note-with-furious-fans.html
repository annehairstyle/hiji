As the show entered its last Knockout phase, the stakes were higher than ever, and contestants were under immense pressure to deliver their best performances. However, the two-hour showing of performances did not go as planned, as fans quickly pointed out that the audio quality was subpar and that they were having difficulty hearing the vocals of the contestants.</p><p>Indeed, every aspect of 'The Voice' relies heavily on technology, from the sophisticated sound and lighting systems to the downloadable app used by fans at home. On Monday, it seemed like those methods were struggling across the board, leaving viewers dismayed and frustrated. As fans watched in disbelief, it became clear that the singers sounded flat, and it appeared that there was a possible issue with the microphones. However, there was something more significant that was off about the audio quality, as the music and other sound elements overpowered the voices of the contestants. This left fans struggling to appreciate the full impact of the performances, with the overall quality being hindered by the audio issues.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=#>'The Voice' 2023 Battles: Fans slam Niall Horan's 'painful' song choice for Tiana vs Kate battle round</a></p><p><a href=#>'The Voice' 2023 Knockouts: Fans wonder whether Kala Banham stole Cait Martin's credit</a></p><h2 class=split>Why was 'The Voice' not audible to viewers?</h2><p>Despite being a popular and widely watched television show, 'The Voice' has been plagued by recurrent technical issues with its audio output. This is not the first instance in which the show has been impacted by such complications, as evidenced by the disappointment expressed by viewers during the finale episode in 2011. In the most recent episode of 'The Voice' in 2023, viewers once again found themselves frustrated by poor audio reception.</p><p>Many took to social media platforms to voice their grievances, highlighting an inability to hear the voices or music of contestants, while coaches' commentary was transmitted clearly. This discrepancy in audio quality suggests that the root of the problem lies within the audio output unit, which appears to be struggling to effectively mix or master the output audio. The negative impact of these technical glitches cannot be overstated.</p><p>As a show that places significant emphasis on the quality of contestants' vocal performances, it is essential that the audio output functions at an optimal level. Any difficulties faced in this regard, as is currently the case, not only detract from the viewers' experience but also potentially jeopardize the fairness of the competition. As such, it is crucial that the show's technical team works to address these issues promptly and efficiently, in order to ensure that future episodes of 'The Voice' are not similarly impacted.</p><h2 class=split>'It's literally called The Voice and the audio is sh**'</h2><p>Fans took to Twitter to express their dissatisfaction. One said, "Okay abolish this voice AI by the end of the week! Why am I listening to Michael Jackson rap munch!!!", while another said, "You’d think for a show called “The Voice” they would make sure to not dampen the vocals in the audio output. I can hear the judges better than the singers during the performance."</p><p>The Instagram video posted by the official handle also had similar comments about the audio issues. One said, "Cannot hear it properly. Please get it fixed the voice team!!!", and another said, "I can barley hear him tbh". Comment like, "People screaming at the back doesn't let me hear him sing" and "can somebody please just fixx the audio quality? I cannot hear jacksh**"&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Okay abolish this voice AI by the end of the week!
