As everyone knows, weight is a very sensitive subject in our society – and nobody understands this better than the people who live their lives under the scrutiny of spotlights and cameras. &nbsp;While some people fight against the pressure that is constantly being put on them to fit a certain image, others use it as motivation to get themselves on track to a healthier lifestyle. When celebrities prove that they can successful drop the pounds, it also inspires many of their fans to do the same. But no matter what their motivation is, one thing is for sure, these stars are looking great! Here are 10 celebrities who lost weight in 2015.</p><p><strong>Biz Markie</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/452687678.jpg alt="Biz Markie At 20th Century Fox Presentation - Comic-Con International 2014" width=594 height=401 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Hip-hop artist, Biz Markie, rose to fame during the 80s with his incredible beat boxing skills. But while Biz became well-known for his ability to make crazy beats with his mouth, he has also become well-known for his size. Throughout his life, he has struggled with his weight, and late last year Markie announced that he had been diagnosed with diabetes, As a result, Markie has worked hard to shed pounds and start living a healthier lifestyle. To date, Markie has lost well over 100 pounds, and has been looking great during his appearances this year.</p><p>(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Kirstie Alley</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/4533913411.jpg alt='kirstie alley at the "kirstie" premiere' width=640 height=505 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Over the course of her career, Kirstie Alley has struggled with her weight several times. With that being said, this isn’t the first time she’s been on a &nbsp;list of celebrities who lost weight. Alley has lost and gained weight multiple times, and it seems like she just can’t seem to keep herself steady. After putting on some pounds last year, Alley decided that this would be the year she got back on track. In January 2015, she announced that she would be signing on with Jenny Craig, and had already lost about 50 pounds.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Robin Marchant/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Paula Deen</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/464147274.jpg alt="KitchenAid® Culinary Demonstrations - STAGES/BOOK SIGNINGS - 2015 Food Network & Cooking Channel South Beach Wine & Food Festival" width=641 height=427 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>There are lots of celebrities who have lost weight, and each of them have had a unique set of challenges. As the queen of southern cooking, Paula Deen’s recipes are full of butter and sorts of other ingredients that aren’t conducive to losing weight. As a result, it should come as no surprise that Deen has struggled with keeping her weight under control. Like Biz Markie, Paula Deen was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and knew that she had no choice but to get a grip on weight.&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Deen, “At that point I went home to my kitchen and I threw out everything that was white: white bread, white rice, white potatoes, white pasta. And I did that for four months, y’all. Just four months. And I lost 35 or 40 pounds.”</p><p>(Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Zach Galifianakis</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/462210972.jpg alt="Zach Galifianakis at the 21st Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards - Show" width=594 height=441 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>When it comes to celebrities who lost weight, there are few transformations that can hold a candle to Zach Galifianakis’. The Hollywood funny guy has become well-known for his chubby look, but this year he decided to ditch the dad bod for a slimmer look. Earlier this year when he showed up at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, no one could believe how much weight he had lost. In order to help losing weight, Gtalifiankis says that he dropped drinking so much, and started walking more.</p><p>(Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Miranda Lambert</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/464930923.jpg alt="Miranda Lambert The 2014 MusiCares Person Of The Year Gala Honoring Carole King - Show" width=640 height=490 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Miranda Lambert’s weight loss journey technically started last year, but the progress she’s made into 2015 definitely can’t be ignored. Even though she was dealing with some personal problems with her now ex husband, Blake Shelton, Lambert was determined to keep her health at the forefront. As a result, she has found a healthy diet that works for her, and says that she feels better than ever.</p><p>(Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Kevin Smith</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/452687556.jpg alt="Kevin Smith in San Diego" width=639 height=427 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>When you think of celebrities who have lost weight, the first people who come to mind are probably huge actors or singers. Well, Kevin Smith may not be either of those things, but his crazy weight loss transformation isn’t any less impressive. This year, Smith posted a photo with his daughter which revealed his much slimmer frame. Smith says his journey has been slow but steady, and he’s lost nearly 90 pounds in the process.</p><p>(Photo by Kent C. Horner/Getty Images for Sirius XM)</p><p><strong>John Goodman</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/491850460.jpg alt="John Goodman in London" width=641 height=437 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>John Goodman has been overweight for almost all of his career – but that isn’t the case anymore. Goodman, who says he was around 400 pounds at his heaviest, is at the slimmest he’s been in a while. When he showed up at a recent movie premiere, he was looking happy and healthy. But while his weight is down, he knows that his journey isn’t over yet.</p><p>(Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Khloe Kardashian</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/451719688.jpg alt="Khloe Kardashian in Las Vegas" width=639 height=425 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>As a member of one of the most famous families in the entertainment business, Khloe Kardashian definitely has a lot to live up to, and she’s certainly no stranger to <a href=#>celebrity gossip</a>. Often compared to her sisters, Khloe’s size has often been the topic of conversation. However, unlike other celebrities who get lost in all the criticism, Khloe’s weight has never seemed to be an issue for her. Still, this year she revealed a slim and chiseled physique that definitely left the haters silent. Guess she told them!</p><p>(Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Abby Lee Miller</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/467967846.jpg alt="Abby Lee Miller At Kids' Choice Awards" width=638 height=424 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>2015 has been a good year for Dance Moms star, Abby Lee Miller.&nbsp;Although fans are used to seeing her being tough on her dancers, she recently revealed a different side of herself. Miller has become one of the latest celebrities who lost weight, and she’s looking better than ever. According to Miller, her inspiration to lose weight came from an interesting place. While her mother was ill in hospice care and not eating, Miller said that she wasn’t eating either.</p><p>(Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Melissa McCarthy</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/475557790.jpg alt="Melissa McCarthy at Spy premiere" width=641 height=427 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>You may be a little surprised to see Melissa McCarthy on a list of celebrities who lost weight. After all, she’s always been open about the fact that she loves her body, and is also one of the few celebrities who has been able to have a successful career despite being overweight.&nbsp;However, McCarthy decided that it was time to get healthy. This year, McCarthy is looking great, and has dropped more than 50 pounds.</p><p>(Photo by Neilson Barnard/Getty Images)</p><p>Lead&nbsp;(Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGhoaWWTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2K5sL%2FTZq6eoZedwW5%2Bj2psaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./adam-levine-made-6-million-owning-a-house-in-montecito-for-just-three-months.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Adam Levine Made $6 Million Owning A House In Montecito For Just Three Months">&larr;
