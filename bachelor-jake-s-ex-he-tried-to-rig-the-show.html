Pilot Jake Pavelka chose his would-be bride, the show’s villain Vienna, earlier this month. Since Jake made his choice, we’ve heard from a woman claiming to be his ex girlfriend, who made an anonymous call to a Florida radio station saying that <a href=#>Jake told her loved her even after the show wrapped</a> and that he said he was contractually obligated to propose to Vienna. Now this ex girlfriend is going on the record with all the dirt she has on Jake and the show, and has shown Life & Style text messages that prove that Jake told her he was with Vienna for publicity. To make matters worse for producers, the ex also claims that Jake only went on the show to make money and schemed to get her on as a contestant in order to rig it.</p><p>Tanya Douglas, 24, lifts the lid on the supposed fairy tale romance between the two reality TV stars, claiming Pavelka is obsessed with fame, was in it for the money and tried to get his ex to be a contestant, too.</p><p>“I don’t think he has any idea what he wants except to be on TV,” Douglas tells “Life & Style” magazine in issues hitting newsstands today.</p><p>“If staying with Vienna means more TV time, I think he might stay with her,” Douglas says of Pavelka, who is now taking a spin on “Dancing with the Stars.”</p><p>Douglas met Pavelka, 32, when he was piloting a flight to Asheville, N.C., in July 2008. He slipped her a note with his phone number via a flight attendant, and their love affair blossomed.</p><p>The pair were in contact until Pavelka’s first brush with reality TV – “The Bachelorette” – and rekindled their romance as soon as he was booted off that show, Douglas claims.</p><p>Then, Pavelka got an invite to be the star of “The Bachelor” and, despite first telling Douglas he didn’t want the gig, he soon changed his mind because of his financial problems.</p><p>“He told me, ‘I know a way I can get out of this financial burden – I could be ‘The Bachelor,'” Douglas told “Life & Style.”</p><p>Pavelka said he’d try to persuade producers to let Douglas be one of 25 contestants.</p><p>“Then it’s rigged for me the whole time, and in the end we can still be together and have the money,” Douglas said he told her. “I’m not going on the show to find love. I’ve found the love of my life with you.”</p><p>Douglas says she was devastated by Pavelka’s decision to put their relationship on hold while he pursued fame on TV.</p><p>As soon as taping ended – with Pavelka shockingly choosing brassy Girardi over classy runner-up Tenley Molzahn – he reappeared in her life, using a strange cell phone number so ABC execs would not find out, she claims.</p><p>Pavelka reportedly told Douglas he was paid $500,000 to be on the series and only had to continue dating his bride-to-be Girardi, 23, for 30 days.</p><p>“The Bachelor” and Douglas continued to speak on the phone and exchange texts through December, until the media started getting wind of their relationship.</p><p>“Tanya, the media is not our friend,” he supposedly wrote in one text. “You ought to protect yourself by telling everyone, ‘No comment.'”</p><p>Pavelka has maintained his relationship with Girardi is real and “incredible,” and the couple have reportedly moved to Los Angeles. He has said his relationship with Douglas “simply did not work out” and there was “no overlap.”</p><p>Douglas isn’t buying it.</p><p>“Vienna is being lied to,” Douglas warns. “The person Jake is on TV is a different person than when he was with me.”</p><p>[From The <a href=#>NY Daily News</a>]</p><p>I like that this is coming out now as it helps expose the kind of sham these shows are. It looks like this guy ultimately chose Vienna despite stringing this girl along, though. She had to have been dumped in order to come out like this. Meanwhile Jake’s fiance, Vienna, is <a href=#>planning a bunch of plastic surgery</a> in order to both keep his interest and get famous. It sounds like he really did find his match.</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.picapp.com/ftp/Images/d/3/0/3/Jake_Pavelka_and_ac83.jpg width=500 height=829 border=0 alt="Jake Pavelka and Vienna Girardi Are a Happy Couple" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.picapp.com/ftp/Images/0/1/d/5/The_Bachelor_winner_97b7.JPG?adImageId=11628635&imageId=8324003" width=500 height=750 border=0 alt="The Bachelor winner Jake Pavelka relaxes with fiancee Vienna Giradi after he performed on the first night of Dancing with the Stars series 10" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmcm1ka4RwrsCcn56kn6esq63KnqqYnaiUtaar06ugnpyPqbygvsiglq2glZTAqbvWaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./bella-baby-name-meaning-origin-and-popularity.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bella - Baby Name Meaning, Origin, and Popularity">&larr;
