Visitors can submit a guess for any star, which forms part of an Average user Guess, seen in the comment section of any page. In 2011 I ran a <a href=#>Height Challenge</a>, illustrating how tall people of various heights can look beside 5ft 8 Rob.</p><p>As part of running Celebheights, I attended conventions, meeting and taking photos with over 1300 celebrities for this site.</p><p><b>Q: What happened to Comments?</b><br>A: <strong>Apologies, but the submission of new Comments is currently off.<br></strong>Voting is still active.</p><p><b>Q: How to submit your Vote (guess) on a Celebrity Height</b><br>A: From October 2016, visitors can Anonymously submit their guess on any Celebrity. Over time, hopefully this will help the site and helps visitors see the general overall opinion on any particular stars height.<br>Voting is anonymous (unless you mention your estimate in a comment), so feel free to add your guesses without fear or influence. I'm the only person who sees voting, so whether you agree or disagree, I appreciate your genuine votes.<br>On the A-Z and Category pages, there is a quick vote option - simply click the 'Guess Heights' button to get guessing.<br>Average guesses get updated every day. Sometimes quicker.</p><p><b>Q: How can I search for a star?</b><br>A: There is a search option at the top right hand corner of every page - it uses Google, is fast and as the 'A-Z' pages have gotten larger over the years, you're best bet is to use the search function to find any celebrity you are interested in. You can also use it to plug in movies/tv shows to find actors/actresses from certain shows of interest.</p><p><b>Q: How can I help CelebHeights?</b><br>A: Keep an eye out for any celebrity who mentions their height and let us know. Also, please help spread the word about CelebHeights by voting, sharing, linking or mentioning the site on your social media, blogs, videos or simply recommend us to others. And keep visiting, because without you, the site wouldn't exist, so thanks and I hope the site provides enjoyment on the occasions you drop by.</p><p><b>Q: How do you find heights?</b><br>A: I try to find quotes from stars about their height. At the moment there are probably 6000+ entries on the site with an actual quote said by the celebrity (or from their agency resume) attributed to them, a large majority of which I have researched myself, with helpful contributions from visitors. That doesn't mean I agree with all of them of course ;-)</p><p><b>Q: Are the heights listed with shoes?</b><br>A: No. Assume every height as though the celebrity was measured barefoot. This isn't the NBA! I make no claim as to whether any listed height is an evening or early morning one, but technically I think you are better off saying your height based on the time when people get measured on average, which obviously wouldn't be out of bed, but might be about 5 hours after waking. After you've been standing for 5-6 hours you won't shrink much more during the rest of the day compared to how much you shrink in the time period from waking up till lunchtime.<br>As of November 2017, there are around 5100 Male and 5100 Females listed, with an average peak height of 5ft 10.75 for the Males and 5ft 5 and 1/4 for the Females.</p><p><b>Q: How accurate are the heights?</b><br>A: Celebheights tries to build an accurate database, but you cannot rely on using official resumes or actors own declarations of their height, because invariably a good percentage might embellish the truth, give their height in shoes, round up or not even know or care. Height in many cases is a best estimate. Even if you meet a star, your own estimate might be off, especially if you don't get within a couple of feet and the difference in your heights is large or you're judging on the street where pavement differences can cause confusion.</p><p>Anybody judging height on streets will find it much harder because most side-walks/pavements are built with varying degrees of fall (sloping) away from the building. You could stand shoulder to shoulder on what looks 'level ground' but one person's feet are 2 inches lower than the other person's. That's one reason why I don't get street photos - they are largely a waste of time for height and I'd rather not pester celebrities in situations were they don't really want to be pestered. I only meet them on occasions were they have chosen to meet fans like Signing/Convention events.</p><p>Contrary to those who believe otherwise, the site has no bias - the purpose of CelebHeights is to try to guess what I think each celebrity would measure. It's as simple as that. Liking or disliking any celebrity has absolutely no bearing on what they get listed at. I may, for instance, not be a fan of say Tom Cruise, but I'll list him the height I think he is.</p><p><b>Q: What about the sightings on the site. Are they reliable?</b><br>A: A proportion of the sightings submitted by visitors to the site are, to say the least, to be taken with a large pinch of salt. Unfortunately anybody could say they've met a star...the internet is filled with untruths which is one reason I moderate comments and won't stand for nonsense. One thing I certainly don't do is BS people. All the quotes I've found made by stars about their heights are real, the 100+ heights I've managed to get directly from celebrities via email or in person are real (for instance when Lenny Henry said, "I'm 6'3". Hugh Laurie is teeny tiny -sleeps in matchbox" he really did say this!), and the encounters and resulting 1000+ photos I've shown over the years should speak for themselves.</p><p>I currently only show photos of myself or Jenny and a handful of friends. If you have photos with celebs you are more than welcome to link to them in the comment section, but I no longer host or promote other photos in the description section of listings.</p><p><b>Q: Who operates this site?</b><br>A: CelebHeights.com is owned and operated by one person since October 2004 - me (Rob Paul), the Editor. I only post and talk about height on Celebheights, my own Youtube Channel and occasionally Quora.</p><p>Anybody claiming or posting under my name on other sites will be an imposter.</p><p>Celebheights has been mentioned in numerous forms of media, including Online Media (like <a href=#>Buzzfeed</a>), radio, TV (such as <a href=#>Conan O'Brien</a>), newspapers (<a href=#>Sunday Mail</a>, <a href=#>New York Post</a>, <a href=#>The Telegraph</a>) and magazines (like <a href=#>Esquire</a>).<br>To contact me about Important matters only, such as bugs, corrections or image related requests, please email me in confidence: (RobPaul AT Gmail.Com). Sorry, I don't answer questions about your height, how tall you look, whether you will grow etc.</p><p><b>Q: Do you have a Youtube channel?</b><br>Yes, check out my <a href=#>Youtube</a> channel for a variety of height related videos.</p><p><b>Q: How tall is Rob?</b><br>A: The lowest I ever measure with a flat floor/wall is a hair over 5ft 8. Out of bed I typically measure around 5ft 8.75. In any photo I have with a celebrity I am roughly 173cm (5ft 8 1/8th). I have worn a variety of footwear in photos, but will always mention as best I can, any difference between my footwear and the celebrities. As of 2021, I weigh 160 pounds.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmhnZmctbW%2FjZympmeRZH9yesetpKU%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./cf-am%C3%A9rica-record-holding-players.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="CF Amrica - Record-holding players">&larr;
