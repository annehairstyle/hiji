He was born on February 9, 1981 in Westminster, London, England. His mother is Diana who works as an administrator of the arts as well as a former stage manager. His father, James, is a physical chemist. He is the second of three children, and the only boy in the family. His younger sister is Emma Hiddleston who is also an actress. His childhood was very affluent. He attended the Dragon School as well as Eton College. His parents divorced when he was still in school, but he didn’t seem too affected by their separation as he was already living away at school and having the time of his own life.</p><p>The one thing that Tom Hiddleston has learned from his parents is that he should be more compassionate of people and their own demons and frailty; something he picked up from them in the midst of their divorce. When he began college at Pembroke College and then the University of Cambridge, he took an interest in the arts. He knew he enjoyed performing and wanted to see where that would take him. While at Cambridge, his role in “A Streetcar Named Desire,” garnered some serious attention by a talent agent who later approached him and ask if he could represent the future actor.</p><p>While he was still a student, Tom Hiddleston began performing on television in various roles throughout England. He became marginally famous, but it was not until he was given the role of Loki in the hit movie “Thor” back in 2011 that he really became a household name in many parts of the world. Most of his roles since then have been more serious and some have even been outside the country. He’s famous, but he’s not the most famous actor in America by any means. He did make a big name for himself when he accepted Jaguar’s offer to become their spokesperson back in 2014. He was part of an ensemble cast of British actors all working as villains in a campaign that was very well-received by most.</p><p>Tom Hiddleston has not made a big deal of his personal life. He is not often seen out in public. He does not appear on many red carpets unless he has to for work or he was invited for a purpose. He is very private and likes to keep his life that way as often as possible. For three years between 2008 and 2011, he was famous for dating Susannah Fielding. The two ended their relationship and he was single for many years until he finally began dating publicly in 2016. He was spotted kissing singer Taylor Swift only two weeks after she ended her relationship with famed DJ Calvin Harris in June 2016. However, neither star has come forward to confirm or deny their relationship or their status. He is very proactive in the charity world, and he continues to become more famous with each role.</p><p>Photo by Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGirqKVdnbalsMueqq2nnmK7psCMsKarrJhk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./what-is-sam-hartman-s-ethnicity-notre-dame-qb-s-nationality-and-more-explored.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Sam Hartman's ethnicity?
