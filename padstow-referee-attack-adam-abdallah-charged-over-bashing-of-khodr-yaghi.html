Mr Yaghi was allegedly pushed to the ground while he attempted to cover his face to protect himself as onlookers screamed “get off him”.</p><p>Bystanders attempt to pull the alleged attacker off the referee.</p><p>NSW Police allege Mr Abdallah punched Mr Yaghi “multiple times in the face and kicked him to the head”.</p><p>He then allegedly fled the scene before fronting Bankstown Police Station on Sunday afternoon.</p><p>Mr Abdallah was charged with wounding a person with intent to cause grievous bodily harm, and affray.</p><p>Mr Krayem told the court his client did not have a history of violence and would be under strict bail conditions.</p><p>Magistrate Glenn Walsh said there was a “considerable time gap” between when Mr Abdallah is hit on the head and “what happens thereafter”.</p><p>“My view is it was a concerted effort for someone in full control of his physical abilities to chase after a man and beat him,” Mr Walsh said. “But what he did, the very ­nature of what happened, betrays an incapacity for control that proves a risk of a further serious offence were he to become upset.”</p><p>Mr Walsh found, despite Mr Abdallah’s background of ADHD and “other issues”, the risk was too great to grant bail.</p><p>Mr Abdallah will return to court in June.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ70qmmq6xfm7ywwMGao6VnkaKutbHUq2Sbp6iav26vx5qpoJ2UYry3sdFmmKWklZyypXnArauam5tivK950Z6dnqqVmnqiwIysppyblad6rq3TnJ9oppWswG6%2F06ipsmeTa4Jzg5ZqnXBuY2d9d4SYbWqfmmNpsXJ8xGudbWljZQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./pete-fredenburg-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-and-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Pete Fredenburg Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth and Family">&larr;
