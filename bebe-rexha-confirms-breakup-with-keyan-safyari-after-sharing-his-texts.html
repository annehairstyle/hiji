This year she became the longest charting woman on two Billboard charts and kicked off her Best F’n Night Of My Life Tour. But instead of just getting to bask in the glow, she keeps having to <a href=#>clap back</a> at internet searches and trolls who can’t let go of the fact that she currently weighs more than she has at other times in her life. Two weeks ago Bebe revealed in an Instagram story that her boyfriend, Keyan Safyari, was <a href=#>among those commenting</a> on her weight. Kaiser said at the time that the posting meant Bebe had broken up with him, and she called it correctly. At a London tour stop last Friday Bebe confirmed to her audience that she and Keyan have split:</p><p>Bebe Rexha has officially called it quits with her boyfriend, Keyan Safyari, after three years together.</p><p>The “I’m Good (Blue)” singer confirmed the news during her Bebe Rexha: Best F’n Night Of My Life performance in London on July 28.</p><p>While introducing her song “Atmosphere,” Rexha told the crowd, “Now I just went through a breakup so I might get a little emotional, so you need to help me here.”</p><p>Rexha, who had been with Safyari since 2020, got support from the crowd, with one concertgoer holding up a sign that read, “You are enough” while she performed her track “I Am.”</p><p>“You really are trying to make a bitch cry,” Rexha joked in response.</p><p>The news comes just two weeks after breakup rumors began swirling, when Rexha posted some text messages, allegedly from Safyari, criticizing her for having gained weight.</p><p>The 33-year-old songstress took to her Instagram story to share a snapshot of the alleged text, in which her then-boyfriend said he was just trying to be “honest” with her about her looks.</p><p>“Hey. I never said you weren’t beautiful and I never said I didn’t love you. In fact I said how beautiful you are and how much I loved you,” the text read. “But I always said I would be honest with you and your face was changing so I told you it was.”</p><p><a href=#>[From ET Online]</a></p><p>Kaiser also laid out in her post how we didn’t have enough context to flat out label Keyan’s text as fat-shaming. I totally agree. We don’t know the full conversation (which is fine, it’s none of our business) and we also don’t know the tone. I generally find that to be a big problem with conversations by text and email: we don’t know exactly how the words are intended. Which is why my initial reaction was “Keyan, NO! This is not something to say by text!” Want to have a compassionate, sensitive conversation with your significant other? Talk with them in person. Or if that’s just not possible (say one of you is on tour), then speak on the phone. That’s my take anyway, if you really want to be honest–like Keyan said he did.</p><p>But that’s enough about him. I’m so relieved Bebe had genuinely supportive fans at that concert (as opposed to the <a href=#>“fans”</a> who express themselves through assault). And a special shout out to the fan who made the “You Are Enough” poster–it clearly meant a lot to Bebe that night. Whoever you are, you did a mitzvah. I’m glad Bebe has this tour right now. I hope performing her songs can be cathartic, and I really hope she soaks up all the love from the crowds. And selfishly, I really really hope she keeps trotting out the fabulous jumpsuits.</p><p><a id=UCLouKwOQNB5NjIfFJsM-A class=gie-single href=# rel=noopener>Embed from Getty Images</a></p><p>Photos credit: Getty and via Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmcWpoa4Z6e8GemZ6XoprFqa2%2BnKannpmnurSrwaucmqOlpay4tdOhlqSdqZa7oL%2FAn7CaqpmUrqfAxKuWrKCRp7avs76hoKyXpJrFtb%2BO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./bendito-sea-jehov%C3%A1-mi-roca.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bendito sea Jehov mi roca">&larr;
