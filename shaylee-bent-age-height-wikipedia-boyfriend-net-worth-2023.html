Her Wiki, Biography</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Shaylee Bent was born on September 13, 2000 in Penrith, New South Wales, to her parents. Shaylee Bent is a professional rugby player from 2017 to date. She is a second-row player for the St. George Illawarra Dragons and the Tweed Heads Seagulls.</p><p>Shaylee Bent is of mixed heritage, with a Greek mother and an Aboriginal, Irish, and Ukrainian father. As an <a href=#>Aboriginal woman</a>, she is proud to be one of the first people to live in her country. Bent’s favorite tradition is yarning circles and listening to elders share their stories – a practice that allows her to learn about different stories and how they have been passed down through generations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/aussiecelebs.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Shaylee-Bent-Age-Height-Wikipedia-Boyfriend-Net-Worth--696x476.jpeg><p>When Bent started playing rugby league for the first time at the age of 14, her athletic career officially began. Due to a lack of players, she joined the under-18s team, and after some hesitation on her&nbsp;part due to the physical nature of the sport, her father eventually agreed to let her play. When she made her first tackle by swinging her arm, her father couldn’t help but laugh.</p><p>Bent always had a strong sense of her Aboriginal identity, but because she was raised in the city, she didn’t have the same ties to her heritage as her cousins who were raised in the country. She was able to learn more about her mob and family thanks to her work at Link-Up, where she helped reunite members of the Stolen Generations and supported them on their healing journey. Bent now feels more confident about her identity and is more willing to share her culture as an athlete and role model.</p><p><strong>Also Read:</strong> <a href=#>Is Natalie Halcro still dating her NFL player Boyfriend?</a></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=David_Fifita_and_Shaylee_Bent_Relationship_Are_They_Dating></span><strong>David Fifita and Shaylee Bent Relationship, Are They Dating?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>David Fifita and Shaylee Bent keep their relationship private, refusing to reveal any details about their relationship, such as how they met or when their romance began.
