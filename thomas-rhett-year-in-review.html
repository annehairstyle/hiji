His down-to-earth charm shines through in all his music and has resulted in him having several hits since his debut in 2012. It was “Die A Happy Man” however, that earned the singer his biggest hit to date. Thomas’ wife Lauren appeared in the music video for the romantic love song and between this and the beautiful lyrics, we all fell in love. It made us hope that one day we would all be lucky enough to find a love like theirs. It stayed at number one on the Hot Country Songs for seventeen weeks and has since been certified three times platinum. Following on from this success, 2017 has been one of Thomas’ best years, both personally and professionally.</p><h3>Family</h3><p>It comes as no surprise that family is one of the most important aspects of Thomas’ life.&nbsp;It’s clear to everyone how strong a bond Thomas and Lauren have. The couple has been married for over five years after meeting in first grade at their school. So, when we heard that they were starting a family together, we could not have been happier for them. They announced that they were expecting a child in February of this year. Their baby girl (Ada James) was born on August 12. A couple of months before this, they also adopted their first child Willa Gray. Thomas is undoubtedly happy with family life and shared a beautiful&nbsp;photo&nbsp;of his wife and daughters earlier this month.</p><h3>Star of the Show</h3><p>Back in October 2016, Thomas released the fifth single from his second album Tangled Up – Star of The Show. The song was the most added song on country radio in the week of its release. Furthermore, as mentioned above, Lauren often stars in Thomas’ music videos and this was no different. The music video was very creative, and no doubt helped with the success of the single. The single reached number one on the Billboard Country Airplay&nbsp;chart in February 2017, giving Thomas his seventh number one.</p><p>You can watch the video for “Star of The Show” below:</p><p></p><h3>Craving You</h3><p>In April 2017 Thomas released the lead single from his at the time upcoming third album Life Changes. “Craving You” was a collaboration with fellow country singer-songwriter Maren Morris and became Thomas’ eighth number one. The music video to accompany the song again featured Lauren. It was also packed with action and featured Thomas and Maren dabbling in crime-related activities, making it feel like a mini-movie. The single hit number one on the US Country Airplay chart in July 2017 and has since been certified gold. As well as this, it reached number one on the Billboard Canada Country chart.</p><p>You can watch the video for “Craving You” below:</p><p></p><h3>Unforgettable</h3><p>Thomas was already having a pretty successful year, but it did not stop there. In July 2017 he released the second single from his new album – “Unforgettable”. The song was co-written by Thomas alongside Jesse Frasure, Ashley Gorley and Shane McAnally, and has a much more laid-back, carefree vibe than his previous singles from this year. It also performed well in the charts hitting number one on the US Country Airplay chart, and Billboard Canada Country chart. As well as this, the song has been certified gold.</p><p>You can watch the official lyric video for “Unforgettable” below:</p><p></p><h3>Life Changes</h3><p>Thomas released his third studio album Life Changes in September 2017 and it went on to be a massive success for the country star. Life Changes consisted of fourteen songs including the chart-topping “Craving You” and “Unforgettable”. The album debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart giving Thomas his first number one album. As well as this, the album was the first country album to top the chart in 2017. The album also hit the top spot on the US Top Country Albums chart. Furthermore, the album has earned Thomas a Grammy nomination for Best Country Album at next years awards.</p><h3>Awards won by Thomas Rhett in 2017</h3><p>In 2017 Thomas was nominated for an array of awards showing just how far-reaching his work has been. Thomas gained nominations at the Teen Choice Awards, Country Music Association Awards and the American Music Awards to name a few. He also won Country Artist of the Year at the iHeartRadio Music Awards. With the success of Life Changes, we predict there will be many more nominations and wins for Thomas in the coming year.</p><p>You can watch Thomas’ acceptance speech at the iHeartRadio Awards below:</p><p></p><h3>Home Team Tour</h3><p>Thomas has had an incredibly busy year with both his career and his family. However, throughout 2017 Thomas still found the time to go out on the road on his Home Team Tour. The tour covered America, Canada and Europe, with Thomas playing in the UK in November of this year. Over the course of the tour, various country artists supported Thomas on the Home Team Tour. These included Old Dominion, Kelsea Ballerini, Ryan Hurd, Russell Dickerson, Brett Young, Dan and Shay and Walker Hayes.</p><h3>Marry Me</h3><p>Thomas’ current single “Marry Me” is a beautiful ballad with a heart-wrenching twist in the lyrics. It is the third single to be released from the number one album Life Changes. So far, the song has peaked at number five on the US Hot Country Songs chart and number twenty-one on the US Country Airplay chart. However, the song is still likely to climb on these charts as it has only been out since November.</p><p>You can watch the video for “Marry Me” below:</p><p></p><h4>Overall 2017 has been a pretty amazing year for Thomas Rhett.
