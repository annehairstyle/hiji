The couple got engaged in October 2011 and they got married on November 11, 2011. They have 4 children together – 3 sons named Kroy Jagger aka KJ (b. May 31, 2011), Kash Kade (b. August 15, 2012), and Kane Ren (b. November 25, 2013), and a daughter named Kaia Rose (b. November 25, 2013). Kaia Rose and Kane Ren are twins.

After the adoption was finalized in July 2013, the girls changed their names to <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Brielle Biermann</a> and <a href=# rel data-wpel-link=internal>Ariana Biermann</a>. Interestingly, Brielle is only about 11 and a half years younger than Kroy. In May 2023, it was revealed that the couple had separated and had filed for divorce. Just one day before he filed for divorce, Kroy had called the cops and accused Kim of punching him in the back of the head during a dispute at their home. In July 2023, it was reported that the couple had called off their divorce. However, in August 2023, it was revealed that Kroy had once again filed for divorce from Kim.</li><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Kroy-Biermann-as-seen-in-an-Instagram-Post-in-August-2016.jpg><h3>Race / Ethnicity</h3><p>White</p><p>He is of American descent.</p><h3>Hair Color</h3><p>Blonde</p><h3>Eye Color</h3><p>Blue</p><h3>Sexual Orientation</h3><p>Straight</p><h3>Distinctive Features</h3><ul><li>Toned physique</li><li>Side-parted, spiked hair</li><li>Cheerful smile</li><li>Clean-shaven look</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Kroy-Biermann-and-Kim-Zolciak-Biermann-as-seen-in-November-2017.jpg><h3>Kroy Biermann Facts</h3><li>As both his parents, both his older sisters, as well as members of his immediate family had names that start with the letter ‘K’, Kroy’s mother wanted to continue this streak with his name. As she was not content with a lot of standard names beginning with the letter ‘K’, she picked up a phone book and found and selected the name ‘Kroy’.</li><li>During his high school years, he lettered (a letter is an award earned in the United States for excellence in school activities) thrice in American football, thrice in wrestling, and twice in track. He was a ‘First-team All-State’ selection and team captain in his junior and senior years, as a linebacker in American football.</li><li>Kroy was also one of Montana’s premier wrestlers at the A level and stood 2nd in the state in his junior and senior high school years. In his senior year, he was the team captain of his school’s wrestling team.</li><li>During his time at the University of Montana, he recorded 32 sacks which were the second-most in the university’s history at that time. In his sophomore (2005) season there, he was tied for a team-high 2 fumble recoveries.</li><li>In his junior (2006) season, Kroy was included in the ‘First-Team All-Big Sky‘. The Big Sky Conference (BSC) is a collegiate athletic conference affiliated with the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association)’s Division I. Its member institutions are located in the states of Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Utah, and Washington.</li><li>In his senior (2007) season, he was again included in ‘First-Team All-Big Sky‘. He was also named the ‘Big Sky Defensive ‘MVP’ (Most Valuable Player)’ after recording 70 tackles, 15 sacks, 18 tackles for a loss, and 5 forced fumbles.</li><li>That year, Kroy also became Montana’s first-ever recipient of the ‘Buck Buchanan Award’, presented annually to the most outstanding defensive player in the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision, the 2nd-highest level of college football in the United States.</li><li>In June 2023, Kim Zolciak reportedly called the police on Kroy after he had allegedly threatened to file kidnapping charges against Kim’s friend after she had taken their son on a playdate. Kim also claimed that he had stolen her bag, which was full of divorce papers.</li><li>In October 2023, Kroy and Kim Zolciak listed their house in Milton, Georgia, for $6 million. They had previously purchased the property in 2012 for $880,000.</li><p>Featured Image by Kroy Biermann / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqSpqLFdl7amvsyapadn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./laura-baugh-biography-age-height-husband-net-worth-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Laura Baugh Biography, Age, Height, Husband, Net Worth, Family">&larr;
