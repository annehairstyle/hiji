Brady is a one-of-a-kind NFL player with an outstanding career full of records, but did you know about his equally incredible mansion?</p><p><strong>Tom Brady lives in Tampa, St. Petersburg with his wife Gisele and their two kids. He and his family are currently renting a 30K-square foot mansion owned by Baseball legend Derek Jeter with direct access to the Tampa Bay area.&nbsp;</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebanswers.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/shutterstock_655026445-791x1024.jpg><p>Although Brady possesses multiple properties across different states in the US, he chose to rent a home in St. Petersburg for a good reason.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Moving to Tampa</h2><p>The main reason why the Brady family decided to <a href=# rel=noopener>move</a> from Brookline to St. Petersburg, was Tom’s transfer to a new team. Brady became part of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the Tampa Bay local NFL team.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Moving out from Brookline and finding a new home in Tampa was a change of pace for Brady’s family and for himself as well. After all, he ended a two-decade tenure with his previous team, the New England Patriots.&nbsp;</p><p>During his time as the Patriots’ quarterback, Brady quickly became a legend in the NFL. But now Brady is trying to create a new legacy with the Buccaneers as he adapts to his new home.&nbsp;</p><p>The house located in what’s known as St. Jetersburg, has 7 bedrooms, 9 bathrooms, and a pool with boat lifts included. This offers them direct access to Tampa Bay by boat, avoiding the city’s traffic.</p><p>Also, Brady’s house in Brookline, Massachusetts, isn’t the only property under his name. He loves helping his wife Gisele with gardening projects from time to time.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>He also has a property in Amenia, New York, where he lived for some time before finally moving out. Brady also takes part in the Yellowstone Club, Montana, where he goes during the summer with his family.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Living the Dream</h2><p>After over 20 years of experience playing in the NFL, Brady is one of the <a href=# rel=noopener>most acclaimed</a> quarterbacks in history. However, Tom still has a lot to give to the sport.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s why his two-year contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers means a new challenge for him.</p><p>As a quarterback, Tom Brady made history over and over again during his time with the New England Patriots. He holds records for completions, MVP awards, yards, touchdown passes, and career Super Bowl attempts.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Although his time with the Patriots is over, Brady is still making new records with his new team, the Buccaneers.</p><p>Among his many records, his winning streak at the Super Bowl is the one that stands out the most; he won six trophies with the New England Patriots. This marks another record in Brady’s career as the only NFL Player to achieve this.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Controversy around Brady</h2><p>However, not everything in Brady’s career is perfect, as he had multiple scandals and issues through his time as a Patriot.&nbsp;</p><p>Just remember the “deflategate” scandal. Tom Brady got suspended for knowing about the use of under-inflated footballs by one of his teammates.</p><p>Yet, another issue involves his behavior on social media. Brady tends to post ambiguous tweets and photos that people often misinterpret.&nbsp;</p><p>A perfect example of this is when he posted a <a href=# rel=noopener>photo</a> of himself walking through a tunnel that leads to a football field without even writing a caption, causing speculations about his career</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Loving Family</h2><p>Brady is not only an exceptional quarterback but a loving father and husband as well. Tom became a father back in 2006 with his ex-partner Bridget Moynahan, but later on, he <a href=# rel=noopener>married</a> the supermodel Gisele Bundchen and had two more kids.</p><p>Brady and his wife are the perfect examples of a great team, as they both succeed in their respective industry and both support each other. The net worth of Tom and Gisele combined is over $500 million, which is another proof of the success of this power couple.</p><p>Brady is also known for being close with his parents and has credited his father for most of his success as a professional NFL player. Brady has stated how grateful he is for his father, as he was the one who helped train and supported him in the early stages of his career</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brady, a Living Legend of Sports</h2><p>Tom Brady is more than proud of his performances with his previous team, The Patriots and recalls those days as the golden era of his career. Nevertheless, Brady still has a lot in him; he’s planning to keep making history, now residing in St. Petersburg and with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as his squad.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCfnqqVYrGwsdJmq6ilXZe%2ForDYZqOirpVk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-angie-k-rhoslc-husband-rumors-net-worth-birthday-net-worth-husband-house-parents-inst.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Angie K RHOSLC, Husband Rumors, Net Worth, Birthday, Net Worth, Husband, House, Parents, Inst">&larr;
