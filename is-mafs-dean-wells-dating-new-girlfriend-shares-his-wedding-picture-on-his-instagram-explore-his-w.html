He revealed,</p><p>‘I am falling for Tracey, yeah,’ ‘It’s a little bit scary, to be honest.’ ‘It can make you feel a bit vulnerable.’</p><p>In addition to this, he said;</p><p>‘It’s a big thing. It means I’ve let her in. I was resisting her a lot at the start, but I think I’ve just opened my mind to her as someone that adds a lot to my life.’</p><p>Moreover, Tracey said that the trust between husband and wife was ‘being rebuilt’ and both of them chose to stay in the relationship.</p><p>Dean <a href=#>said</a>,</p><p>‘We were together until I was 30, and we had a great time. We had an amazing marriage for those years, but in the end, it just didn’t really&nbsp;work out.’</p><p>Previously, the couple faced difficulty in their married life.
