Warren Steed Jeffs was born on the 3rd December, 1955 in the home of Rulon Jeffs (1909-2002) and Merilyn Steed (born in 1935).&nbsp;Warren was born over two months early within Sacramento, California.</p><p>In July of 2004, Jeffs’ nephew, Brent Jeffs, filed a lawsuit claiming that Jeffs had raped him in a sexually explicit way at the church’s Salt Lake Valley compound in the latter part of the 1980s.&nbsp;Brent wrote his book Lost Boy, along with the author Maia Szalavitz, which recounts allegations of sexual assaults allegedly committed by Jeffs and his brothers and family members, that were committed at a time when Brent was 5 or six.&nbsp;Brent’s brother Clayne took his own life after accusing Jeffs that he sexually assaulted him when he was a child.&nbsp;Two of Jeffs nephews, as well as two of Jeffs children have also publicly stated that they having been sexually assaulted by Jeffs.</p><p>In 2005, Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Report published the following statements made by Jeffs:</p><p>In June 2005, Jeffs was charged in Mohave County, Arizona, with sexual assault on a minor and with conspiracy to commit sexual misconduct with a minor for allegedly arranging, in April 2001, a marriage between a then-14-year-old girl and her 19-year-old first cousin, Allen. The young girl, Elissa Wall (then known as “Jane Doe IV”, and the younger sister of Rebecca Wall), testified that she begged Rulon Jeffs to let her wait until she was older or choose another man for her. The elder Jeffs was apparently “sympathetic”, but his son was not, and she was forced to go through with the marriage. Wall alleged that Allen often raped her and that she repeatedly miscarried. She eventually left Allen and the community.</p><p align=justify>Before his father’s passing at the age of 22, Jeffs had the job as a counselor to the church’s leader.&nbsp;Jeffs was appointed Rulon’s successor and his official title within the FLDS Church becoming “President and Prophet, Seer and Revelator” and “President of the Priesthood”.&nbsp;The latter included being the in charge of the group of the church’s male members of all ages who were judged worthy of the priesthood which is a tradition that continues throughout the Latter Day Saint movement.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=9><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Warren Jeffs</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Warren</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Jeffs</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sect Leader</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>December 3</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1955</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sacramento</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>California</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sagittarius</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Father</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Rulon Jeffs</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Mother</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Marilyn Steed</strong></td></tr><tr readability=9><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Lyle Jeffs, Seth Jeffs, Nephi Jeffs, Isaac Steed Jeffs, Ward Jeffs, Leslie Balmforth Jeffs, Blaine Balmforth Jeffs</strong></td></tr><tr readability=5><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Merrianne Jessop , Nolita Collen Blackmore , Annie Mae Blackmore, Millie Blackmore</strong></td></tr><tr readability=4><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Rachel Jeffs, Roy Jeffs, Becky Jeffs</strong></td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Warren Jeffs ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?

Jeffs specifically taught that a devoted church member is expected to have at least three wives in order to get into heaven, and the more wives a man has, the closer he is to heaven.</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Net Worth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$5 Million</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Salary</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Under Review</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Source of Income</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Sect Leader</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Cars</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>House</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Living in own house.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>On 8 June 2006, Jeffs returned to Colorado City to perform more “child-bride marriages.” On 27 May 2008, The Smoking Gun website released images of Jeffs with two underage wives, one of whom was 12 years old, celebrating one-year anniversaries in 2005 and 2006.</p><p>On 5 April 2006, Utah issued an arrest warrant for Jeffs on felony charges of accomplice rape of a teenage girl between 14 and 18 years old.

The ranch came into the public eye on 7 April 2008 when Texas authorities conducted a raid and took legal custody of 416 children, in response to a 31 March phone call alleging physical and sexual abuse on the ranch. The caller claimed to be a 16-year-old girl married to a 50-year-old man who had, at age 15, given birth to his child. Residents, however, told authorities that there was in fact no such girl, and the calls were ultimately traced to 33-year-old Rozita Swinton, totally unconnected to the FLDS Church, and known for repeated instances of filing false reports. Nevertheless, Texas authorities continued to investigate whether Swinton’s claims were a hoax. The women and children who were suspected of being minors were returned after Texas courts established that the state had not presented sufficient evidence of abuse to have removed them.</p><p align=justify>On 10 June 2006, Arizona Attorney General Terry Goddard told the Deseret News that he had heard from several sources that Jeffs had returned to Arizona, and had performed marriage ceremonies in a mobile home that was being used as a wedding chapel.</p><h2>Who is Warren Jeffs Dating?</h2><p>According to our records, <strong>Warren Jeffs</strong> married to <strong>Merrianne Jessop , Nolita Collen Blackmore , Annie Mae Blackmore, Millie Blackmore</strong>.
