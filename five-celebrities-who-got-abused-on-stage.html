That person, aside from being a total bully, was quite upsetting and it’s difficult as a child to get over that. Your mom, dad, teachers and other role models and mentors would tell you over and over again that some people just aren’t nice and that even if you’re the nicest person in the world, there will always be someone that just does not like nice people. You cannot please everyone is the lesson here, and it’s especially true of celebrities. Even the most beloved celebrities in the world are sometimes hated by people that just can’t stand them for some reason or another. And while most celebs do nothing worthy of the kind of hatred that is issued at them, there are still people that cannot just keep their opinions to themselves. While most people just ignore those they don’t care for, some people are just so rude that they have to go out of their way to make a person’s life miserable.</p><p>And for these celebrities, people really went out of their way to make them feel poorly. They were abused on stage, and it’s just not cool. Fans or not, you shouldn’t abuse people just for being someone or something that might not be quite your taste. These celebs were doing nothing but performing, which is their job, when crazed fans or foes decided it would be appropriate to toss items at them that might not seem normal. Many rock stars are used to bras and things of that nature being thrown at them on stage, but some of these items take that kind of thing to a whole new and very creepy level. Find out who was abused by their fans and what they were abused with by continuing to read.</p><h2>Adam Levine</h2><p>In the middle of an autograph signing frenzy outside of the Jimmy Kimmel studio, Maroon 5’s front man and reality show judge Adam Levine was attacked by a sugar bomb. Someone in the group of people surrounding the singer and his entourage apparently doesn’t like the “Sugar” singer and made the decision to throw a homemade bomb made of powdered sugar at the singer. He was covered from head to toe, face, hair and all, in powdered sugar. While his fans were screaming in outrage, he managed to keep himself together and calm, and he exited with as much dignity as he could muster in a situation that was probably infuriating to him. While it wasn’t nice, we are impressed that Levine chose to handle the situation with class by removing himself.</p><h2>Justin Bieber</h2><p>While performing at a show in Brazil, the Biebs was hit on stage with a blue water bottle thrown by a fan in the audience. He wasn’t hit hard and it wasn’t something that would have hurt him, but the singer did not handle the incident very well. He stormed off the stage and caused more of a scene than was probably necessary. However, there is some girl somewhere in the world that gets to say, “I hit that,” when discussing the Biebs; literally.</p><h2>Kanye West</h2><p>It’s not a big secret that Kanye does not like things that do not go his way. He becomes very upset when things are not to his liking and he will actually stop a show until people are doing what he wants them to do; he’s shown us this on multiple occasions. But when a fan tossed a coin onto the stage when he was performing at a concert once, he actually stopped. At first he implored his fans to stop throwing hard objects on stage and we were on board with that one. It wasn’t out-of-line or even crazy; just a simple request, “Please don’t throw hard things at me. It might hurt,” and we respect that. But it true Kanye West form, he took it a step further and probably made his fans want to throw harder objects at him when he said, “I was having a perfect show, flawless victory.”</p><h2>Adam Lambert</h2><p>While performing at one of his shows, he didn’t miss a beat when someone in the audience tossed their very personal toy at the stage and hit him in the leg. Probably the most important question here is how someone was allowed to bring in an intimate toy or object in the first place, but also, why throw it at the man performing? We are happy to say, however, that Lambert didn’t even miss a beat when he merely kicked the sexual object from the stage and back into the crowd. He didn’t even react. We bet whomever it hit when it went down into the audience did not find it nearly as amusing, however. It’s our opinion that this goes down as perhaps the most disgusting object ever thrown at someone on stage. We can only hope it was a new one and not something that had been used in the past.</p><h2>One Direction</h2><p>While performing as a group, Harry Style was pelted with numerous tampons on stage. It appears that they were unopened and unused, but it’s our guess that this young man was a little shocked to see such intimate objects being tossed his way on stage. After all, he’s not very old as it is and this was a while ago, so it was probably shocking. He did not say a word about the incident, but he did look a little shocked and a little confused when the tampons were being thrown at him. We can’t say we blame him, though. Those are not objects you want to toss out of your bag. I mean, you never know when you are a close friend with you is going to need one. And what a bummer to realize you need one just after throwing them all at your favorite young band while they were on stage.</p><p>Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGidoq6VYrCmuMSbqaKsmZrAbrPOrWSamqWosqV50q2YoJ1f</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./hannah-sluss-shows-off-her-incredible-figure-in-sky-blue-beach-bunny-two-piece-bathing-suit.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hannah Sluss Shows Off Her Incredible Figure In Sky Blue Beach Bunny Two-Piece Bathing Suit">&larr;
