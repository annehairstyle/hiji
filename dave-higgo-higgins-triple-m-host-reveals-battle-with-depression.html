I was ignorant. I was in denial. I was losing my mum.”</p><p>As his mum’s health began to deteriorate rapidly, Higgins reached out to his half brother Craig, who still hadn’t met his mum.</p><p>They told him to get to Melbourne as soon as possible. There wasn’t much time left.</p><p>“Word came in that Craig was arriving one evening, and by this time, mum wasn’t well, all we could do was be by her side.</p><p>“We knew she could hear us as she would furrow or raise her eyebrows in response to things we would say. I would sit by her side, stroking her forearms and we would all remind her that Craig was coming, to just hang on.</p><p>“My sister and brother-in-law raced to the airport to pick up Craig and get him back to the hospital.</p><p>“As soon as I saw him, I knew he was my brother. He looked almost identical to my brother Warren. It was a bit freaky to be honest.</p><p>“After days of laying relatively motionless, with eyes shut, we told mum that Craig was here. She sat up, her eyes opened and she announced, ‘I’ve waited your whole life for this’ and hugged him with the strength of a thousand men.</p><p>“The next night, March 13th 2002, mum was gone.”</p><p>“I didn’t know it at the time, but this would be the nucleus for my downward spiral into depression,” said Higgins.</p><p>He returned to work two weeks after his mum died but he couldn’t shake the pain of her death.</p><p>“What I didn’t realise at the time was that I had changed, and not for the better,” said Higgins.</p><p>“I had become more abrasive, less tolerable, and while I worked hard, I can only imagine how it must have looked from the outside.</p><p>“To their credit, work persisted with me.”</p><p>In 2004 Higgins was encouraged by his dad to take an online test through <a class=body-link href=#>Beyond Blue</a>.</p><p>“The results scared me,” said Higgins, “so I ignored them”.</p><p>In 2008 Higgins received another wakeup call when a close friend took his own life, but again he pushed his emotions to one side. It wasn’t until 2010 that those feelings caught up with him.</p><p>“I was driving back from an outside broadcast at Phillip Island and I fell into a state of mental breakdown,” said Higgins.</p><p>“I pulled over at a service station and broke down.</p><p>“This was my lowest point of my life and I really didn’t trust myself to drive home in fear of what I might do to myself.</p><p>“With help of family on the phone, I made it home. And it was then, I finally realised that I needed help.</p><p>“I felt useless, hopeless, pointless, disappointing, I had no self worth, no self esteem,” Higgins said.</p><p>“But I went to my GP,” said Higgins, “and that day changed my life”.</p><p>“It was the hardest thing I’ve ever had to do. To sit down and admit that I had a problem.</p><p>“I thought I was weak. I thought I was failing as a man.”</p><p>Higgins is now working on several shows on<a class=body-link href=#> Triple M Melbourne</a>, including the <a class=body-link href=#>Rush Hour</a>, Distortion and 90s and New Rock at Night.</p><p>He’s on medication and despite occasional dips in mood, insists he’s a much happier person now that he’s asked for help.</p><p>“I haven’t written this story for sympathy,” Higgins said.</p><p>“I’ve written this to share my own challenges and to assure anyone who happens to read this that you are not alone.</p><p>“The world will not be the same without you. Don’t fight it on your own. Ask for help. It’s hard, perhaps the hardest thing to do, but please, talk.”</p><p>You can read Higgo’s full story on the <a class=body-link href=#>Triple M Melbourne website</a> and you can<a class=body-link href=#> follow him on Twitter</a>.</p><p><i>If you, or someone you know needs help, please contact Lifeline on 13 11 14 or go to the <a class=body-link href=#>Beyond Blue </a>website.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb6%2FOpmWarV%2Bau7Wx0a2Yoqadmru1e9OvZquZlJ68cLDAr5xmoJmctLB5x6KeoKGeqHq1vsipo55lnWK1sL%2FTZqmerpWWubR5wZqrraSVYsSqwMdmm56ooprAtLXOp2annaeoerTAzquwaG5nmLCigcWfbHBwZ22FdnySa5hpbpZofnWvwXBrb25j</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./donald-trump-vs-e-jean-carroll-defamation-trial-live-updates-analysis-reactions.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Donald Trump vs E.
