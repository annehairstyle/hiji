He has, however, occasionally discussed Bond and their relationship. He revealed that he resides in the same home as Bond in an interview with The Age published in February 2009.</p><p>According to The Sydney Morning Herald, Bond has been living with the actor and his family for 13 years. Long-term relationships have existed between the two, however, it is unknown if they are married. Pedersen has had prior marriages. According to his IMDb website, he was married to his ex-wife Lisa Serma from 1999 to 2000.</p><h2><span id=Bond_produced_a_film_about_Vinnie_Pedersen_Pedersen8217s_brother>Bond produced a film about Vinnie Pedersen, Pedersen’s brother.</span></h2><p>In foster homes in Alice Springs, Pedersen and his brother Vinnie were raised. Only one year younger than his older brother, Vinnie has cerebral palsy and a mild intellectual disability.</p><p>The actor learned his sister had special needs when he was seven years old. Despite living in foster homes and experiencing challenging times, Pedersen always made sure to take excellent care of his sibling.</p><p>Sarah Bond’s brother, in turn, would adore him more than anything else in the world. In the same interview with The Sydney Morning Herald, he remarked that he is eternally thankful for having his brother.</p><p>He’s still here with me. I’ll be eternally thankful. He’s still on my path. He’ll always be a part of my life. Sarah Bond was a superb travel companion on this trip. He stays faithful to himself. He always makes me chuckle.</p><p>‘I’m more famous than my brother,’ he continuously asserts.<br>He further claimed that having his own children is not an option since he considers his brother his child and wants to spend his whole life with him.</p><p>In 2006, Pedersen and his partner developed the moving short documentary My Brother Vinnie, which focused on the two brothers’ unbreakable connection. The documentary was written by Goldstone, directed by Steven McGregor, and co-produced by Bond and his spouse.</p><p>“She’s like a big sister to him, and she loves him just as much as I do, and that’s all I want. We truly arrived as a bundle. “ Pedersen discussed his partner’s role in taking care of his sibling in an interview with SMH.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>Jonathan Groff, Who Is Out Gay, Discusses A Relationship Gone Wrong</a></strong></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Dane Cook Has Had Plastic Surgery Because Of His Weight Loss</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>John Molner- Everything About His Relationship</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVflnqlu8KupJ6mpJa%2FunnOp2SpnZSav7Sxzaxkm6qfqbWmvoywmKxlnZaxpnnBsmSsmaKWtW6uzqebaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./alok-nath-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alok Nath Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr;
