There is a limit of one voucher per client. It is necessary to produce the coupon at the time of purchase. This offer is not applicable in conjunction with the stated $19.99 or $17.99 Conventional Oil Change prices</p><p></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-148 data-inserter-version=2></span><h2>Is tyre rotation included in the price of an oil change?</h2><p>A complimentary four-tire rotation is included with the Full Synthetic Oil Change Offer.</p><p></p><h2>There were 38 related questions and answers found.</h2><p></p><h2>How much does it cost to have your oil changed at Walmart?</h2><p>In Walmart auto centres, the cost of changing motor oil varies based on the kind of oil you buy and whether or not you take advantage of discount coupons.
