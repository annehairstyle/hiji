He claimed that he had a meeting with the boss. Which was a lie. The truth was that he wanted to kill everyone there and he almost succeeded in doing so. It wasn’t until the massacre was over that he realized he missed someone.</p><p>There was a guy that was in the breakroom when the shooting began and he escaped through a window before he too could be corned. Devon didn’t have his phone. He went straight for the closet police station. He tried to report what happened and he instead saw the shooter waiting for him outside the station. The shooter had apparently found his phone. He realized Devon got away and he tried to finish the job.</p><p>Only Devon didn’t know this man. He had no idea why this man would shoot up his office or kill his coworkers. He just knew what he looked like and that this man was now hunting him. He sought out the vigilante for help. He turned to Robyn and Robyn promised to do what she could. She told him that she would keep both him and his mother safe.</p><p>Her first step in doing that was to go visit the office. The place of a massacre and what should have been littered with bodies and instead they found nothing. They didn’t find bodies. The whole place had been cleaned up. There was even signs of someone filling in holes that the bullets left. It was even painted to look old.</p><p>It was very professionally made up to look like no massacre took place. The only thing stopping the lie was Devon. Devon witnessed the murders and he was the only remaining witness to what happened. Its why the killer was hunting him. The killer must be working with a group of people because that office building was spotless.</p><p>There was a cover up in play. Robyn didn’t know who was behind it. Only that they’ve done this before. She had Harry check surveillance cameras. He said all the cameras in the area were shut down for a three hour window in which the murders took place. And that he got an image from someone hiding from the cameras after that murder window closed.</p><p>Harry sent Robyn that image. She identified the man in the picture as Colton Fisk. Fisk was CIA. He was also involved in a mission that got several agents killed and so Robyn didn’t exactly trust him. She came to believe he was behind this massacre. She tracked him down. She questioned him only for him to deny any part in what happened. He claimed that he was there to investigate. He said he was just looking into it for his own reasons and Robyn knew she couldn’t push him on that. And so she asked him if he could identify the shooter.</p><p>There were cameras outside of the police station. Harry got a photo of the shooter and Fisk recognized him. He identified him as Carlos Ruiz. Ruiz was a part of the Nicaraguan Special Forces. He claimed not to know why Ruiz was killing people in New York and so Robyn had her people look into it. It seems that someone from Devon’s company had looked into Nicaragua. The company was supposed to be in charge of Marine Biology Research. They mostly focused on North America and one guy’s search history showed that he turned his search to South America. He googled the words “Nicaragua. Power. Stone”. Hence the Nicaragua connection.</p><p>Harry managed to track down Ruiz. He was still trying to kill Devon. He even went to Devon’s apartment building to wait for him. Robyn went to the building with Fisk and they split up to cover more ground. Somehow Fisk found Ruiz first. He killed Ruiz. He claimed that Ruiz pulled a gun on him and that he had to kill him, but that didn’t quite match with what she found on Ruiz’s body. Ruiz had a very well-done American passport. She used his cell phone to call his last contact and it turns out that Ruiz was an agent with the CIA. Fisk had been lying to her about Ruiz’s connection with the agency. She demanded to know why and so he revealed a little more of the truth. He claimed that there was a secret Black Ops mission within the Agency called “Nomad”.</p><p>Nomad was started several years ago. It was supposed to be about agent destabilizing nonfriendly countries and started false flag operations. It soon became more when they stopped caring about casualties. Which was when Fisk had it shut down. He tried to stop it and someone decided to start it back up again. Ruiz had been a part of Nomad. Someone sent him to kill everyone at this company because of one google search. It turns out the guy was looking into a lithium mine in Nicaragua that the Americans wanted. They just couldn’t invade Nicaragua like they wanted and so they started to plant false flags operations.</p><p>They tried to start a war between Nicaragua and Honduras. Honduras being an ally of the US. Except it didn’t work out like they planned because of General Stone. Stone stopped Americans from invading. Fisk had told Robyn that he thought a man named Ian Tate was behind the program getting restarted. Only it wasn’t him. It was actually the director of the CIA. Director Platt wanted to start a war with Nicaragua to get ask to their lithium mine that could be worth trillions of dollars. It was like the war for oil all over again. Fisk had just figured out for himself when he and Robyn were forced to defend General Stone for getting murdered on US soil.</p><p>Fisk’s flamethrower did most of the work, but he got evidence on the Director. He was going to blackmail the man into shutting down the program when Robyn took a different approach. Robyn collected evidence against the director and she handed it over to a journalist. It eventually went live on tv. The director was forced to step down. And the program got shut down once and for all.</p><p>And Devon got to return to his apartment now that it was safe.</p><p>Detective Dante didn’t help out with this case because his friend was shot and he wanted to be there for him. Only this situation with his friend reminded him that he didn’t give his father a fair chance. And so he decided to be there for his dad when he got out of prison.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnpJ2ybrHQrpiloaqav26%2BxJyYqWVgaHpzgoxramarlZbAsLqMbGSeqJmovKWxjGpqZqiRqb%2Bqu9NmnpqllWQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./three-in-roman-numerals.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Three in Roman numerals">&larr;
