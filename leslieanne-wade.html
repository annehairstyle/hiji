She will remarry Gold legend Tom Watson when she is around 57 or 58 years old. Leslie is a long-time executive at CBS Sports Network, and Tom Watson is an eight-time major champion. The couple exchanged rings on May 7th while visiting the University of Notre Dame, where Ms. Wade was attending a reunion with her undergraduate friends and former coworkers. The pair has yet to organize their wedding, but they have publicized the date and are expected to marry on July 9th in New Jersey. They confirmed their wedding date to Golfweek but declined to remark on the festivities.</p><p>The couple said that they have known one other for almost 15 years. Watson, who is roughly 72 years old, has 39 PGA Tour victories. He was previously married to his late wife Hilary, who died in 2019 after a battle with pancreatic cancer. Leslie, on the other hand, married Kevin Michael McGinn in 1999, and the couple has three children, all of whom are now adults. Maggie is one of their children, while the other two are sons called Gavin and Ronan. Ms. Wade’s recognized and growing career has resulted in a tremendous fixture and respect in the golf world. Tom Watson resigned from golf in 2019 after a 50-year career in which he won 70 titles and served as Ryder Cup captain twice.</p><h2><span id=LeslieAnne_Wade8217s_Professional_Career>LeslieAnne Wade’s Professional Career</span></h2><p>Leslie, who is getting about to marry her fiance Tom Watson for the second time, began her professional life and hustled in 1994 after finishing her studies.
