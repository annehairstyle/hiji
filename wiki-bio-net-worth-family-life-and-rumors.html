Images of the Wild, On The Edge: Balancing Earth’s Resources, Tapestry of Life, Our 50-State Border Crisis: How the Mexican Border Fuels the Drug Epidemic Across America, and Forty Chances: Finding Hope in a Hungry World are just a few titles under his belt.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/website-76.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Personal Relationship</h2><p>Howard has been married two times and also has a son.

They are:</p><ul><li>In the 1970s, he was involved in the acquisition of Wesco Financial Corporation, which was investigated by the SEC for possible violations of securities laws.&nbsp;He and his partner Charlie Munger had to pay $115,000 to Wesco shareholders as a settlement.</li><li>In 1977, he bought the Buffalo Evening News, which sparked an antitrust lawsuit from a rival newspaper.&nbsp;He eventually won the case, but not without damaging his reputation in the media industry.</li><li>In 1990, he was implicated in the Salomon Brothers scandal, when one of the firm’s traders admitted to submitting false bids for U.S. Treasury bonds.</li><li>In 2010, he was named as the successor of his father as the non-executive chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, a move that raised some eyebrows among investors and analysts.&nbsp;Some questioned his qualifications and experience for the position, while others wondered if he would be able to maintain his father’s legacy and vision.</li><li>In 2019, Phoenix New Times reported that Howard Buffett used his dad’s money to join a police force in Arizona.
