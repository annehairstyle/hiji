It was one such instance for&nbsp;Storage Wars’ Jarrod Schulz when he met his life partner Brandi Passante, who changed his life for the good despite not needing a mere title of wife. Intriguing?

The series first aired on the network in 2010 and made&nbsp;him a huge hit among audiences, so much so that he had&nbsp;his own show focused primarily on his family called Brandi & Jarrod: Married to the Job in 2014.</p><p><strong>Storage Wars:&nbsp;</strong>The cast of Storage Wars shares their best Jarrod and Brandi stories&nbsp;(Published: 23 August 2012) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The reality star is also an established entrepreneur who owns Now and Then Thrift Store based in Orange Country.
