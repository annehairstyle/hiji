He has also used Phoenix and Stream bass models.</p><p>Arguably, Benton's claims have always been tongue-in-cheek as his purported "Satanism" has since largely been defined as vehement anti-Christian atheism complemented with theatrics suitable for the band. In the July 2008 issue of Revolver Magazine, Benton stated there was no ideological agenda in Deicide and the music was first and foremost.</p><p>In 1993, newspapers reported that Benton had expressed an interest in, and participated in, the burning of live rodents such as rats and squirrels. During an interview with NME Magazine, Benton shot a squirrel with a pellet gun: Benton explained it was to prevent any further damage to his electrical system and other contents in the attic of his home where the interview was held. The publicity led to an attempted bomb attack on Benton during Deicide's Legion tour at the International 2 in Manchester, England, by an animal rights organization. Benton was also beaten up in Bradford. A similar attack was attempted at a previous show in Stockholm, where a supposed small fire bomb was set to detonate during Deicide's set. No one was injured, but the bomb damaged the venue. The bomb was reported to be an M-80. The tour was curtailed.</p><p>The self-titled 1990 debut album of his group Deicide featured a song entitled "Sacrificial Suicide", in which Benton was alleged to have claimed that in order to achieve a life opposite that of Jesus he planned to commit suicide at age 33. This claim that he would commit suicide at the age of 33 continued throughout the 1990s. However, he passed that age in 2000 and did not commit suicide. In 2006, he stated that these statements had been "asinine remarks" and that "only cowards and losers" choose to kill themselves.</p><p>In the early-to-mid-1990s, Benton was a frequent opponent guest to Christian radio shows, such as Bob Larson's "Talk Back" show. Though a serious discussion rarely took place on the program, the exchanges between the two mainly consisted of taunts from Benton and tongue-in-cheek teasing. Larson continually invited Benton to his talk show, but Benton often declined.</p><p>Benton was born in Niagara Falls, New York but was raised in Tampa, Florida. It was here on July 21, 1987, after guitarist <a href=#>Brian Hoffman</a> replied to Benton's advertisement in a local music magazine, Deicide was formed. Within days the band, consisting of Benton (bass/vocals), Hoffman, Hoffman's brother Eric (guitars) and <a href=#>Steve Asheim</a> (drums), was named "Amon", after the Egyptian deity. Within a month, Amon had recorded the crude Feasting the Beast 8-track demo in Benton's garage and had started playing the occasional gig in the Tampa area. In 1989, Amon recorded their second demo, Sacrificial, at Morrisound with producer <a href=#>Scott Burns</a>. Benton also collaborated on Mexican metal band Transmetal's album el infierno de dante with the choruses, under the production of <a href=#>Scott Burns</a> in Morrisound, which almost sold 100,000 copies.</p><p><a href=#>Glen Benton</a> (born June 18, 1967) is an American death metal musician. He is best known as the lead vocalist and bassist for the death metal band Deicide and was also a part of the band Vital Remains, where he has performed in recording sessions as well as live with them on a few occasions. He is currently collaborating with Egyptian artist Nader Sadek on his next record "The Malefic: Chapter II". He is known for very low guttural growls as well as very high shrieks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfnLmmuoybnKesn6M%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./greg-saniatan-height-weight-age-girlfriend-facts-biography.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Greg Saniatan Height, Weight, Age, Girlfriend, Facts, Biography">&larr;
