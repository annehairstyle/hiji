Sure, we're not going to be downing beers at the Cubbie Bear (thanks a lot coronavirus!) but we will get America's favorite pastime on our televisions sooner rather than later. Plans are to have a mini-season of 60 games starting in late July, at least as of now. With Covid-19 raging out of control from coast to coast, things can change quickly. Behind the scenes, the owners of Major League Baseball teams have been trying to find ways to make their sport viable during a global pandemic. Cable sports channels have been airing classic games. Basically, the public is clamoring for baseball. Fortunately, we don't have to wait too much later. Let's take a look at the owners of the teams in the National League and how they made enough money to own a Major League Baseball team.</p><p><strong>Arizona Diamondbacks</strong></p><p><strong>Owner/Managing Partner:</strong>&nbsp;Ken Kendrick</p><p><strong>Purchase price:</strong>&nbsp;$238 million (2004)</p><p><strong>Current franchise valuation:&nbsp;</strong>$1.29 billion</p><p>Ken Kendrick founded Datatel, Inc, which provides information processing and software products for higher education. He owns the Diamondbacks alongside Jeffery Royer and Michael Chipman. All three have owned at least a part of the team since its first season in 1998. Kendrick is a baseball card collector with more than 10,000 baseball cards. In fact, Kendrick paid $2.8 million for a T206 Honus Wagner card, which is the most expensive baseball card in history. Kendrick is 77.</p><p><strong>Atlanta Braves</strong></p><p><strong>Owner:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>John C.

For 24 years, from 1973 to 1996, Malone served as President and CEO of Tele-Communications Inc. (TCI). Malone is now chairman of Liberty Media, Liberty Global, and Liberty Interactive. As of 2011, Malone surpassed <a href=# title="Ted Turner Net Worth">Ted Turner</a> as the largest individual private landowner in the United States, owning 2,100,000 acres of land, most of which is in Maine.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-303352 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-98452706.jpg alt width=900 height=684 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-303352 class=wp-caption-text>Tom Ricketts, owner and Chariman of the Chicago Cubs (Photo by Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Chicago Cubs</strong></p><p><strong>Owner:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=#>Thomas S.

They bought properties at rock bottom prices and flipped them for a profit. Wilpon was the subject of controversy for investments he made with <a href=# title="Bernie Madoff Net Worth">Bernie Madoff</a> in 2008 when Madoff was convicted for running a Ponzi scheme. Reportedly, Wilpon lost $700 million because of Madoff, which triggered speculation that he may be forced to sell the team. Eventually, Mr. Wilpon agreed to pay $162 million to the trust for Madoff's victims. Thus, the Mets were in financial setbacks in recent years, not having enough money to sign big league players.&nbsp;Currently, the Mets are for sale with <a href=# title="Alex Rodriguez Net Worth">Alex Rodriguez</a> and <a href=# title="Jennifer Lopez Net Worth">Jennifer Lopez</a> among the leading bidders.</p><p><strong>Philadelphia Phillies</strong></p><p><strong>Managing partner:</strong>&nbsp;John Middleton</p><p><strong>1981 Purchase price:&nbsp;</strong>$30 million</p><p><strong>2020 Team Valuation:</strong> $2 billion</p><p>In 1856, John Middleton's great-great-grandfather founded a small cigar producing business that more than 100 years later, launched the Black & Mild brand of cigarettes.
