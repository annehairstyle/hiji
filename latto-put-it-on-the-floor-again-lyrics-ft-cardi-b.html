Hip-hop fans are in for a treat with the release of "Put It On Da Floor Again," a dynamic collaboration of Latto and Cardi B.<h2>Latto Put It on the Floor Again Song</h2><p>If you've been scrolling through TikTok or any social media platform lately, you can't escape the infectious bop of Latto's "Put It on Da Floor." This catchy tune has taken over the internet, with its irresistible lyrics like "rip me out the plastic, I've been acting brand new" providing the perfect backdrop for stunning prom outfits, dazzling nail sets, and flawless hairstyles. People are literally breaking free from plastic, and it's a spectacle to behold.</p><p>Since its release on April 21, Latto's single has become an unstoppable force, dominating social media feeds everywhere. The rapper herself has been fueling the hype with hilarious videos of her friends rapping along to the lyrics. But it doesn't end there—Cardi B couldn't resist joining the viral trend, and she did it in the most exciting way.</p><p>On May 31, Latto dropped a teaser for the "Put It on Da Floor" remix, now titled "Put It on Da Floor Again," featuring none other than Cardi B. And guess how they announced this epic collaboration? By participating in the TikTok trend, of course. Latto shared a clip across her social media platforms, declaring, "'Put It on Da Floor,' now I'm about to 'Put It on Da Floor Again.' Remix this Friday." She then playfully motioned towards someone hidden under a black plastic bag and exclaimed, "Rip her out the plastic, she's been acting brand new." Moments later, a glammed-up Cardi B appeared.</p><p>True to their word, the dynamic duo unleashed their remix on June 2, accompanied by an iced-out music video that exudes pure swag. The visual extravaganza features surprise appearances from Offset, Cardi B's husband, and Angel Reese, a star from LSU's women's basketball team. The video opens with Latto dramatically breaking free from a plastic-wrapped package, and before you know it, Cardi B joins the scene with her explosive verse. She confidently raps, "Put a ribbon on me, I've been acting brand new / I'm not smoking on just anything, I'm smoking on you / Your bestie can join the pack, I'll smoke her too / I've been balling so hard, could've gone to LSU."</p><p>Latto's TikTok moment and the remix are the latest highlights in her already stellar year. After dropping her sophomore album, "777," in early 2022, she kicked off 2023 with the hit single "Lottery" featuring Lu Kala. She's been making waves with collaborations alongside rising talents like Mello Buckzz, Lola Brooke, and TiaCorine. As if that wasn't enough, Latto is currently rocking stages on the second leg of Lizzo's "The Special 2our" and bagged two Grammy nominations for Best New Artist and Best Melodic Rap Performance this year. A press release teasing Latto's "Put It On Da Floor Again" promises more new music, vibrant visuals, and big energy from the unstoppable artist as she embarks on the next chapter of her remarkable career.
