He achieved the feat in Malaysia’s 3rd match of the round-robin stage of the 2022 Malaysia Quadrangular Series (a T20I tournament that also involved Bhutan, Maldives, and Thailand) – recording sensational bowling figures (4/17 in 4 overs) against Thailand who were bowled out for a meager 30 runs in 13.1 overs.</li><li>Malaysia won this match by 9 wickets and Syazrul was named the ‘Player of the Match’ for his performance. In the team’s 5th (and penultimate) match of the round-robin stage of the tournament, also against Thailand, he produced match-best bowling figures (4/21 in 3.5 overs) as Malaysia easily overhauled Thailand’s score of 73 runs, winning with 9 wickets to spare. He was named the ‘Player of the Match’ once again.</li><li>Malaysia finished the round-robin stage of the tournament with a perfect 6-0 win-loss record. In the final,&nbsp;he once again recorded match-best bowling figures (3/13 in 3.1 overs) to limit Bhutan to a paltry total of 82 runs. Hosts Malaysia cruised to a 9-wicket win to lift the title as Syazrul finished as the leading wicket-taker in the tournament (16 dismissals).</li><li>On July 26, 2023, he created history by becoming the first cricketer ever to have captured 7 wickets in a men’s T20I match – during the opening game of the ICC (International Cricket Council) Men’s T20 World Cup Asia B Qualifier tournament. He picked up the first 4 Chinese wickets to fall – in the 5th over (his 2nd) of their innings – to reduce them to 13/4. He then captured the 5th Chinese wicket as well – in the 7th over (his 3rd).</li><li>In his 4th (and final) over (the 9th of the Chinese innings), a maiden (an over in which no runs have been scored off the bat), Syazrul scalped 2 more wickets to leave China reeling at 20/9. He finished with eye-popping bowling figures – 7 wickets for just 8 runs in 4 overs that included 20 dot balls (balls off which no runs are scored). Incredibly, all 7 of his victims were ‘bowled’ (a mode of dismissal in which the ball delivered by a bowler hits the stumps, either directly or after some contact with the bat or the batter’s body).</li><li>China’s team eventually folded for just 23 runs (the then 3rd-lowest total ever in a men’s T20I match) in 11.2 overs. 6 of their 10 dismissed batters registered ducks (a duck is a batter’s dismissal for a score of zero) and 5 of those 6 were dismissed by Syazrul. Malaysia went on to win the match by 8 wickets (with a massive 91 balls remaining) and Syazrul was named the ‘Player of the Match’ for his historic performance.</li><li>Malaysia won its 3 remaining matches in the competition as well to become the champions of the 2023 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Asia B Qualifier tournament – as Syazrul finished the tournament as the highest wicket-taker overall (10 wickets in 4 innings at a scarcely believable bowling average of 5.60 runs conceded per wicket taken).</li><li>The tournament triumph qualified Malaysia for participation in the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Asia Regional Final tournament to be held in October and November 2023. The top 2 teams in this tournament would then progress to the 2024 edition of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup.</li><li>Syazrul’s aforementioned bowling figures (7 wickets for just 8 runs in 4 overs) were not just the then best by a male cricketer in the T20I (T20 International) format, they were also the then best figures by a male cricketer in any senior-level T20 match (international or domestic). The only other male player, as of July 2023, to have picked up 7 wickets in any senior-level T20 match (international or domestic) was South Africa-born Dutch international Colin Ackermann who recorded figures of 7/18, representing the Leicestershire Foxes against the Birmingham Bears, in August 2019.</li><li>In men’s T20I matches, Syazrul bettered Peter Aho’s record (6 wickets for just 5 runs in 3.4 overs) that was set in October 2021. Peter was representing Nigeria, in a match against Sierra Leone.</li><li>As of July 2023, Syazrul (50 wickets in 26 matches) had the 2nd best career bowling strike rate (10.40 balls bowled per wicket taken) by a male cricketer in the T20I format – only behind Dhruv Maisuria of Botswana (10.33). He also had the 4th best career bowling average (11.62 runs conceded per wicket taken) by a male cricketer in the T20I format – behind Yalinde Nkanya of Tanzania (8.60), Dhruv Maisuria of Botswana (8.98), and Vraj Patel of Kenya (10.15).</li><li>As of July 2023, Syazrul was also the 2nd fastest male cricketer to have reached the milestone of 50 wickets (achieved in 25 matches) in the T20I format – again, only behind Dhruv Maisuria of Botswana (22 matches).</li><p>Featured Image by Jagran English / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqywmrKiqrlutcOrrKxn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-2019-mtv-vmas-nominees-are-here.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The 2019 MTV VMAs Nominees are Here!">&larr;
