Nusret Gökçe, better known as Salt Bae is a Turkish butcher, chef, food entertainer and restaurateur who is best known for his technique for preparing and seasoning meat, which became an internet meme in January 2017.</p><p dir=ltr>He is the owner of Nusr-Et, a chain of luxury steakhouses. Currently, Nusr-Et has branches in Turkey, Greece, the United States, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia as of 2021. He got the name of his restaurant chain from his own name and the Turkish word "Et", which means “meat”.</p><h2 id=who-is-salt-baes-wife-1 dir=ltr>How did Salt Bae become famous?</h2><figure class=image contenteditable=false>Source - Instagram</figure><p dir=ltr>During the years 2007 to 2010, Gökçe worked in local restaurants for free in Argentina and the United States to gain experience as a cook and restaurateur. He opened his first restaurant in Istanbul in 2010, and later opened another one in the United Arab Emirates the same year.</p><p dir=ltr>A series of viral Internet videos and memes that showed Salt Bae cutting meat and sprinkling salt, for recipes such as 'Ottoman Steak', made him more widely known in January 2017. He was called “Salt Bae” because of his strange way of sprinkling salt, dropping it from his fingertips to his forearm and then onto the dish, after the post was seen 10 million times on Instagram. Since this post, Gökçe's profile has greatly expanded, and he has served many celebrities and politicians from around the world.</p><figure class=image contenteditable=false>Source - Instagram</figure><p dir=ltr>Furthermore, Gökçe has received a fair share of criticism that has only served to further his popularity. He was criticized in December of last year for taking a photo that looked like a picture of former President Castro of Cuba. During a failed fire show in September 2018, a Czech internet personality suffered 35% total body surface area burns. Several other guests also suffered minor burns. In the same month, Gökçe was criticized by the U.S. Senator Marco Rubio and the Miami City Council after President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela had a meal at his restaurant in Istanbul.</p><p dir=ltr>In November 2019, four former employees said that Gökçe took a part of their tips. They claimed that they were laid off from his New York restaurant when they asked about the tips. The settlement was reached with his former employees, who were paid $230,000 after a trial was set to take place to investigate the issue. His dismissal was due to his dissatisfaction with the performance of the four employees. Since they were laid off, they appeared to be doing something about it and made these tip claims.</p><figure class=image contenteditable=false>Source - Instagram</figure><p dir=ltr>Due to violations of COVID-19 safety standards, public health officials ordered his restaurant to close for several days after it opened in late September 2020. It reopened in early October 2020. A £37,000 bill for a meal at one of his UK restaurants in October 2021 was under scrutiny from the British media.</p><p dir=ltr>Gökçe was the subject of online criticism after joining the Argentine players on the field after the World Cup final and handing the trophy to the winner in December 2022. FIFA therefore initiated an investigation into Gökçe's actions during the final.</p><h2 id=who-is-salt-baes-wife-2 dir=ltr>Where is Salt Bae from?</h2><p dir=ltr>Sale Bae was born and raised in Turkey.</p><h2 id=who-is-salt-baes-wife-3 dir=ltr>What is Salt Bae’s net worth?</h2><p dir=ltr>Different sources say Salt Bae has a net worth of up to 70 million dollars.</p><h2 id=who-is-salt-baes-wife-4 dir=ltr>FAQs</h2><figure class=image contenteditable=false>Source - Instagram</figure><h3 id=who-is-salt-baes-wife-5 dir=ltr>Q.
