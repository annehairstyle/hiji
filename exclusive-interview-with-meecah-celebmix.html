The 21-year-old rising star has been singing since the age of 3 and has been heavily influenced by her father who was a founding member of the iconic American funk/soul group&nbsp;The Commodores.</p><p>Here we speak exclusively to Meecah about her dad’s influence, new music, future plans, and much, much more;</p><p><strong>Your father was one of the founding members of The Commodores how much did that inspire your love of music?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I wouldn’t say that he was the founding member of The Commodores, but my father was a part of the process with the original band in Tuskegee, Alabama when they were in college. His passion for music spilled over into our church, and when I was born it spilled over into me. My father’s experience as a musician created a love for funk, Prince, and live music. He NEVER let me leave the car until I could tell him who was on what instrument and on what measure “Did the horns come in”. I find myself putting those similarities into my performances, and into my records. I love a hard percussion/wind section when I perform live, and if the Bass player ain’t right, I’m all the way off. Thank God I have an incredible band.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Have you always known you wanted to be a professional singer?</strong></p><p>Since I was born.</p><p><strong>Who are your personal musical icons?</strong></p><p>Prince, Whitney Houston, Peabo Bryson, Anita Baker, Beyonce, Marc Anthony and Rihanna.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>If you could collaborate with anyone who would you choose?</strong></p><p>Dead: Prince.<br>Alive: Romeo Santos&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is the main inspiration behind your new single ‘Dream’?</strong></p><p>I feel like sometimes we can get friend zoned so quickly by people who we think are just “so fine”. I wrote the lyrics from the POV of someone who is tired of being overlooked by her best friend. She is ready to be with this boy that she knows would want her if he actually paid attention to her instead of all the other females that have no idea about what he needs. People always think that a “Dream” only takes place when you’re sleeping, this dream is definitely reality and I wanted to say that with this song.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you have any touring plans lined up?</strong></p><p>One can only pray, but I feel one coming down the pipeline very soon.</p><p><strong>When can fans expect an album from you?</strong></p><p>I really want to put an album out once I am signed to a major label so that it can truly reach as many people in the best way possible. Until then, #PackMeecah can be on the lookout for more singles and EP’s&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What do you hope to achieve over the course of your career?</strong></p><p>I really would love to win as many awards as possible but most importantly, I want to change the worlds way of thinking. I want to let them know that anything is possible for them, I want to make music that inspires people to love beyond levels unimaginable. I want reach a point in my career where I’m being considered for major movie roles, Broadway and I financially want to take care of my immediate family because they (more than anyone) have sacrificed more than anyone in my life, for me to get where I am and what I have.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>Make sure you follow Meecah on Twitter <a href=#>@MeecahMeecah</a> to keep up to date with all her latest music and tour news!</p><p><strong>Did you enjoy our exclusive interview with Meecah?
