Starring Patti Stanger as the matchmaker, the series has featured several intriguing clients, including the one we got to see in season 4 (which premiered in 2010). The variety of stories and complications seen through these cast members naturally made the world very curious about the lives of those who wanted to avail of Stanger’s services.</p><h2>Derek Prefers a Priavte Life and Bryce is a Proud Mother of Five</h2><p>Let’s start with Derek Tobacco, the man who was seen in the very first episode of season 4. Based in Staten Island, New York, he was the Vice President of tZERO Group until November 2019. Preferring to lead a private life, the Blockchain Consultant has since not shared any update regarding his positions of responsibilities, but his expertise in his chosen field, combined with his business acumen, leaves us positive that he is doing well in life.</p><p>As for Bryce Gruber, the heiress seems to have carved her own path in life. As of writing, she is not only the Commerce Content Director for SJC but is also the Executive Editor of Today’s Parent. Based in Woodstock, New York, she is an expert in the matter of digital growth and has written two books. On a more personal note, she is happily married to her husband, Yossef, and has five beautiful children: Benny, Rivkah, Avi, David, and Milli.</p><h2>Albie Got Married and Chris is an Author</h2><p>Brothers Albie and Chirs Manzo are actually the sons of ‘The Real Housewives of New Jersey’ star Caroline Manzo. Let’s first talk about Albie, who is the Co-Founder of Bloom and Birch. Additionally, he is the Founder of IV Strategic and continues to utilize his business skills to further himself. He also has a podcast called ‘Dear Albie.’ As for his romantic life, the reality TV star got married to Chelsea DeMonaco on October 25, 2023, in a beautiful ceremony surrounded by their loved ones.</p><p>Chris Manzo is the younger brother who works alongside Albie on BLK beverages as well as Little Town New Jersey Restaurant.

He also enjoys partaking in delicious food and can almost always be seen enjoying the company of his friends and family.</p><h2>David Has a Podcast and Jason is in the Education Industry</h2><p>Having achieved much success in the world of business, David Yontef has seemingly taken a step back to focus completely on his work as an entertainer. The New York native now has a podcast called ‘Behind The Velvet Rope,’ which is focused on various Bravo programs, particularly the ‘Real Housewives’ franchise. With thousands of followers on various platforms, David releases new episodes every day and likes to remain on top of every possible news.&nbsp;As for Jason Teich, he is based in Brooklyn, New York, and continues to serve as the President of Allen School and International Training Careers.</p><h2>Beth Shak is a Businesswoman and Sean Hull is a Consulting Expert</h2><p><img decoding=async data-attachment-id=822074 data-permalink=https://thecinemaholic.com/the-millionaire-matchmaker-season-4/beth-1/ data-orig-file=https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Beth-1.jpg data-orig-size=1200,885 data-comments-opened=0 data-image-meta='{"aperture":"0","credit":"","camera":"","caption":"","created_timestamp":"0","copyright":"","focal_length":"0","iso":"0","shutter_speed":"0","title":"","orientation":"0"}' data-image-title="Beth 1" data-image-description data-image-caption data-medium-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Beth-1.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Beth-1.jpg?w=1024" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecinemaholic.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Beth-1.jpg alt width=1024 height=755 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Renowned poker player Beth Shak, AKA Beth Silverberg, prefers to lead a private life.

He is the founder of Heavyweight Internet Group and has worked independently in technical consulting for more than twenty years. Having worked at some reputable firms such as The Hollywood Reporter and NBC/iVillage over the course of this time, he has excelled professionally.

Aptly known as “Miss Romance,” she continues to enjoy her work to the fullest and can often be seen enjoying her time on sets.</p><h2>Leah is Suing Bravo and Jordan is Happily Married</h2><p>Leah McSweeney has certainly cemented her place as a reality TV star, given her position as a main cast member in seasons 12 and 13 of <a href=#>‘The Real Housewives of New York City</a>.’ However, she is presently in the middle of a legal battle against Bravo as she is suing the organization for not letting her grieve her grandmother properly during the production of ‘<a href=#>The Real Housewives Ultimate Girls Trip</a>‘ season 3. The Founder of Married to the Mob and Happy Place has her own video show and is the proud mother of Kier Marie.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jordan Osher seems to be doing quite well in life.
