Additionally, the young vlogger also aims to launch her own makeup line someday.</p><h4><span>Details regarding 00RemakeGirls channel</span></h4><p>On 9 December 2012, she published a live cover of Maroon 5’s “Wipes Your Eyes” on 00RemakeGirls.

Then, in October 2010, while at Notre Dame High School, Gabi began dating Brandon Grube. They had both met during the summer two months before the new school year started.</p><p>Brandon asked Gabi to go to his Senior Homecoming with him and gave her a stuffed dog. They had their first kiss waiting for the bus to come standing outside his locker. Gabi had to ask her parents permission before she could accept Brandon as her boyfriend because of their age difference.</p><p>By February 2011, Gabi was suspicious of Brandon and was worried that he might be cheating on her but didn’t say anything for fear of losing him. However, in June she found out that he had indeed cheated on her.&nbsp;During the Christmas break the same year, Brandon broke up with Gabi.</p><p>After the weekend he started dating Gabi again. During the April of Gabi’s Freshman Year of College, her parents bought Brandon a MacBook and Gabi was looking through his Skype and found out that he had another girlfriend of 9 months, since August. After this Brandon broke up with Gabi again.</p><p>During summer 2015 Gabi met Collin Vogt whilst still technically in a relationship with Brandon. While on a break with Brandon, Gabi was seeing a guy who she refers to as Joey while she was at college. Gabi describes him as the guy who broke her heart (they broke up in early July 2015).</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Details_with_Collin>Relationship Details with Collin</span></h2><p>On 25 July 2015, Gabriella started dating Collin Vogt. Then in late 2018, they moved in together in a cottage in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. They call the cottage The Castaway Cottage. For their 4 year anniversary, they went to Bermuda and plan to have a second home there one day. Gabi and Collin hope to have children together.</p><p>In Gabi’s vlog “I threw up during an expensive massage“, published on 9 August 2019, she revealed that when she and Collin have kids they want to raise them in Bermuda. She also revealed in her next vlog that she’d moved out of the “Cinderella Cottage” in LA because she only went there a couple of times a year. She said that in about a year’s time she and Collin will hopefully get a second home in Bermuda.</p><p>On 10 February 2020, Gabi shared a Q&A video with Collin and he confirmed that he was going to propose to Gabi very soon. They also said that they would name their children if they were girls, Elowyn and Clara, and if they were boys, Eden and River. They also revealed that they will be renting a house in Bermuda for a month in June or July 2020 and they would like to get married on an island and have a honeymoon somewhere cold and to see the Northern Lights.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-37143 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographymask.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Gabriella-Demartino-with-her-boyfriend.jpg alt="Gabriella Demartino" width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-37143 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Gabriella Demartino and Collin photographed together.
