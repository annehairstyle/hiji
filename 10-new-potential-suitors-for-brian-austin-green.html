Rising to fame in the popular TV series, Beverly Hills, 90210. However, in 2010, Green was officially off the market when he married actress, Megan Fox. Although the two have a more than 10 year age difference, their relationship seemed promising. With celebrity couples getting together and breaking at very high rates, it was nice to see a couple who managed to keep their relationship positive and low-key. However, after 11 years of marriage, and giving birth to two beautiful children, Green and Fox have decided to call it quits. While the couple’s fans may be heart-broken over the split, there are probably plenty of other people who are excited that these two are back on the market. With that being said, here are 10 potential suitors for Brian Austin Green.</p><p><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/151990196.jpg alt="Kourtney Kardashian" width=640 height=456 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>After [finally] breaking up with her long time boyfriend, Scott Disick, Kourtney Kardashian is back on the market. While dating a member of the Kardashian clan may seem risky, other than her public problems with Disick, Kourtney seems to be pretty fun and laid back. &nbsp;Plus, the 36-year-old is the proud mother of three, and understands the demands of raising a family in the public eye.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Michael Stewart/Getty Images for Kardashian Kollection)</p><p><strong>Katy Perry</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/470188219.jpg alt="katy perry" width=639 height=452 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Katy Perry is one of the biggest names in pop music. Over the course of her career, the&nbsp;30 year-old star has released several hits and sold out arenas all over the world. After dating several actresses, Green may be interested in trying his luck with someone in the music industry. Especially because Green also had a short stint in the music industry – releasing his debut album in 1996. Although the album was a complete flop, it might not hurt to live vicariously through someone who is actually successful.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Anthony Harvey/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Brandi Glanville</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/141846476.jpg alt="26th Annual Genesis Awards" width=642 height=454 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>After her breakup with actor, Eddie Cibrian, reality&nbsp;TV star, Brandi Glanville, has been looking for love. Unfortunately, she has yet to find the perfect guy – but all of that could change. Although she can be a bit of a firecracker, she definitely seems like the kind of person who knows how to enjoy life. After an 11 year marriage, Green will likely be looking for a relationship where he can have fun and let loose.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images for The Humane Society)</p><p><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/158231892.jpg alt width=641 height=458 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Jennifer Lopez is one of the hottest celebrities in the game. Even at 46-years-old, she’s still turning heads &nbsp;and making headlines. Throughout her career, her singing and acting abilities – combined with her good looks – have helped her to become a household name. Like Green, Lopez was once married to a fellow star and they both know the stress of trying to maintain a marriage while living life in the spotlight. And let’s be real, these two would look pretty hot together.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Scott Barbour/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Miranda Kerr</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/160946978.jpg alt="Miranda Kerr Hosts David Jones Fashion Workshop" width=642 height=428 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Former Victoria Secret model, Miranda Kerr, is well-known for her pretty face. However, there’s much more to the multi-talented star than just good looks, and over the course of her career she has proven that she’s a pretty hard worker. Kerr married actor, Orlando Bloom, in 2010, the couple separated three years later. &nbsp;Since Green doesn’t seem to have anything against dating women who are younger than him, striking up a relationship with the 32-year-old Kerr shouldn’t be a problem. Although Kerr is reportedly dating, as the only saying goes ‘if you’re not married, you’re single.”</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Graham Denholm/Getty Images for David Jones)</p><p><strong>Charlize Theron</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/481517920.jpg alt='Premiere Of DIRECTV&#39;s "Dark Places" - Arrivals' width=641 height=426 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>After sources reported that Charlize Theron and Sean Penn called it quits, it seems like Theron is back on the market. The Academy Award winning actress has definitely established herself as one of the greatest stars of her generation, and her ability to take on any role is amazing. Although Theron is far more famous than both Brian Austin Green and Megan Fox, it might be nice for Green to date an established star who knows how to balance the crazy demands of super stardom.</p><p>(Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Katie Holmes</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/461467880.jpg alt="72nd Annual Golden Globe Awards - Arrivals" width=640 height=419 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>For the last several years, Katie Holmes has been one of the most eligible bachelorettes in Hollywood. Although there have been lots of rumors circulating that she is dating Jamie Foxx, both have denied the claims. With her girl next door charm and wholesome good looks, Katie Holmes could definitely be the perfect person for Brian Austin Green to move on with.</p><p>(Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Shannen Doherty</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/108087494.jpg alt="The Weinstein Company And Relativity Media's 2011 Golden Globe Awards Party - Arrivals" width=641 height=427 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>For a second, let’s forget about the years of rumors that have accused Shannen Doherty of being incredibly rude and egotistical and remember that she and Green were once co-stars on Beverly Hills, 90210.&nbsp;While it would seem a little bizarre if these two got together, stranger things have definitely happened. Plus, old friends have a way of popping back into each other’s lives.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by David Livingston/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Jennifer Garner</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/457575222.jpg alt="ELLE's 21st Annual Women In Hollywood - Arrivals" width=639 height=425 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>After her split from Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner may officially be Hollywood’s hottest bachelorette. There probably aren’t too many men – famous, or otherwise – who wouldn’t jump at the chance to be with Garner. With three children each, Brian Austin Green and Jennifer Garner would definitely make a really cute blended family.</p><p>(Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)</p><p><strong>Vanessa Marcil&nbsp;</strong></p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritytoob.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/103970884.jpg alt='ABC&#39;s "General Hospital" - 2010' width=640 height=442 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Vanessa Marcil and Brian Austin Green dated during the early 2000s while working on 90210. Unfortunately, the couple’s relationship ended after giving birth to their son. Now that they are both single, it’s a very really possibility that they may be interested in rekindling an old flame.</p><p>&nbsp;(Photo by Alberto E.
