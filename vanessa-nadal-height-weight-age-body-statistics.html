A couple of days later, he invited her to another show. After that show, they went out with a bunch of friends and he got to know more about her. In September 2010, they got married at the Belvedere Mansion in Staatsburg, New York.&nbsp;<span style=font-weight:300>At the wedding reception, Lin-Manuel, accompanied by his friends and family members, performed his rendition of a popular song titled </span>To Life<span style=font-weight:300>.
