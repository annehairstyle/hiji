He is the world indoor record holder for the 60 meters dash. He is also a prominent 100 meters and 200 meters runner.</strong></p><p><strong>He was a double silver medallist at the World Championships in Athletics in 2017. He competed collegiately for the Tennessee Volunteers. He attended high school at Our Lady Of Mercy Catholic High School in Fayetteville, Georgia.</strong><span id=more-245206></span></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=christian-coleman-age></span>Christian Coleman Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Christian was born on March 6, 1996. He is currently 23 years old as per 2019.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=christian-coleman-career></span>Christian Coleman Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=college></span>College<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>At Tennessee, Coleman was the 60 meters champion and 200 meters runner up at the 2016 SEC Indoor Track and Field Championships. He then went on to win the 200 meters at the National Track and Field Indoor Championships and was 3rd in the 60 meters. He was the runner-up in both the 100 meters and 200 meters dash at the 2016 NCAA Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships.</p><p>After coming off an outstanding sophomore season, one that ended in making the 2016 Olympic team, he continued his success in his Junior season at Tennessee. During his indoor campaign, he set PRs throughout the season resulting in world-leading times in the 60 meters and 200 meters dash.</p><p>Coleman took gold in both events at the 2017 Indoor National Track and Field Championships in historic fashion. He ran 6.45 seconds in the 60 meters, tying the collegiate record, and 20.11 seconds in the 200 meters, just 0.01 seconds off the collegiate record held by Wallace Spearmon.</p><p>Christian finished his collegiate career by winning the 100 meters dash in 10.04 seconds and the 200 meters in 20.25 seconds at the 2017 NCAA Division I Outdoor Track and Field Championships.</p><p>Coleman joins former Tennessee sprinter, Justin Gatlin, as the only other person to sweep the 60 meters and 200 meters indoor titles, and the 100 meters and 200 meters outdoor titles.</p><p>Coleman received some notoriety after the 2017 NFL Draft scouting combine.</p><p>John Ross set a new combined record of 4.22 seconds in the 40-yard dash and claimed he was faster than Olympic champion sprinter Usain Bolt. Coleman responded to this by running the 40 yards in 4.12 seconds on turf.</p><p>Coleman was Tennessee’s first winner of The Bowerman in 2017, an award that honors collegiate track and field’s most outstanding athlete of the year.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=professional></span>Professional<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Coleman qualified for the 2016 Olympic Trials in both the 100 meters and 200 meters. He placed sixth in the final of the 100 meters, potentially qualifying him for the 4 × 100 m relay team. On July 11, Coleman was named to the US 4 × 100 m relay team. At the Olympics, Coleman ran the second leg for Team USA in the 4 × 100 m relay qualifying as the team won their heat with a time of 37.65 seconds.</p><p>The team that ran in the finals, without Coleman, was disqualified. In 2017, he claimed silver at the IAAF world championships, with a time of 9.94 seconds, behind Justin Gatlin and ahead of Usain Bolt in his final 100 meters race. He also ran the anchor leg for the US 4 × 100 meters relay team at the championships, finishing second with a time of 37.52 seconds, 0.05 seconds behind Great Britain.</p><p>Coleman began his 2018 indoor season with a world record time of 6.37 seconds in the 60 meters at the Clemson Invitational in South Carolina, breaking Maurice Greene’s near 20-year-old record by two one-hundredths of a second.</p><p>However, his time was not submitted for ratification as a world record by USA Track & Field due to the event neither providing for electronic starting blocks, which measure reaction times in preventing false starts, nor a zero gun test, which checks that the automatic clock-timing system start and capture sequence are properly recorded.</p><p>But, one month later, on February 18, 2018, at the United States Indoor Championships in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Coleman clocked a world record time of 6.34 seconds in the 60 meters final, thus breaking Maurice Greene’s previously-held record.</p><p>He went on to win the 60 meters world indoor title at the IAAF World Indoor Championships in Birmingham, clocking a championship record of 6.37 seconds. The time is also the fastest recorded indoor performance at sea level. It is his first gold medal at the major championships.</p><p>At the 2018 Diamond League finals in Brussels, Belgium, Coleman clocked a blistering 9.79-second run into a −0.3 m/s wind during the men’s 100 meters final, improving his personal best by three-hundredths of a second.</p><p>This performance marked Coleman as the joint 7th fastest performer of all-time tied with Maurice Greene in the history of the event, as well as winning him his first Diamond League trophy. The time was the fastest run over the previous three years.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=christian-coleman-100m-time></span>Christian Coleman 100m Time<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h3 class=entry-title><span class=ez-toc-section id=christian-coleman-runs-the-worlds-fastest-100m-of-2019></span>Christian Coleman runs the world’s fastest 100m of 2019<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>A month after being edged at the finish line, Christian Coleman left no doubt on Thursday. He is the world’s fastest man this year, not to mention this Olympic cycle.</p><p>Coleman won the 100m at a Diamond League meet in Oslo in 9.85 seconds, breaking his tie with Noah Lyles and Nigerian collegian Divine Oduduru atop the 2019 world rankings. Neither Lyles nor Divine was in Thursday’s race, but neither of them has ever broken 9.86, either.</p><p>“I’m pretty excited about it. It was a good run and a pretty good time,” Coleman said, according to meet organizers. “Now I’ll look back at the video and critique it. It wasn’t ideal conditions but … I executed better than in the last race.”</p><p>Lyles put Coleman’s 100m dominance to the test, beating him by .006 on May 18 in Coleman’s first race since Aug. 31. Both clocked 9.86 in Shanghai.</p><p>But Lyles is focusing on the 200m this season, while Coleman is bidding to race both the 100m and 200m at the USATF Outdoor Championships next month. The top three at nationals qualify for those individual events at worlds.</p><p>Coleman has progressed from being strictly a 4x100m prelim runner at the Rio Olympics to taking silver at the 2017 World Championships between Justin Gatlin and Usain Bolt. Then last year, Coleman came back from an early-season hamstring injury to clock 9.79, the world’s fastest time since the Rio Olympics.</p><p>In other events in Oslo, 19-year-old Sydney McLaughlin beat the reigning Olympic, world and U.S. champions to become the 400m hurdles favorite for next month’s USATF Outdoor Championships as well as the world championships.</p><p>McLaughlin, who in Rio became the youngest U.S. track and field athlete to compete at an Olympics in 44 years, rebounded from hitting the first hurdle and coming around the last curve multiple steps behind Dalilah Muhammad.</p><p>She passed the Olympic champion in the sprint off the last hurdle for her first career win over Muhammad in her Diamond League 400m hurdles debut.</p><p>McLaughlin’s time — 54.16 and .19 faster than Muhammad — was .02 slower than her domestic season opener, but she beat not only Muhammad but also U.S. champ Shamier Little and world champ Kori Carter.</p><p>“It wasn’t the cleanest race for me, but I came back strong, and that shows me where I am fitness-wise,” McLaughlin said, according to meet organizers. “It was a sloppy race, but I pulled through.”</p><p>World champion Emma Coburn took fourth in the 3000m steeplechase, 4.71 seconds behind Kenyan winner Norah Jeruto. Jeruto clocked 9:03.71, handing countrywoman and world-record holder Beatrice Chepkoech her first steeple loss since May 31, 2018.</p><p>Olympic champion Brianna McNeal was disqualified from the 100m hurdles for a false start. Another American, Christina Clemons, ended up winning in 12.69. McNeal has yet to race world-record holder Keni Harrison this season. They ranked Nos. 1 and 2 in the world last year — Harrison in 12.36 and McNeal in 12.38.</p><p>World champion Johannes Vetter won the javelin but pulled out after one legal, 85.27-meter throw with a right adductor injury. He was competing for the first time since August after missing time with a left leg injury.</p><p>World champion Sam Kendricks won a pole vault duel with Swede Mondo Duplantis by clearing 5.91 meters. Duplantis, who turned pro after his freshman season at LSU, cleared 6.05 meters at the 2018 European Championships, matching the world’s best since 2001.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=christian-coleman-net-worth></span>Christian Coleman Net Worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Christian Coleman is 5ft 9in tall and he’s about 157 pounds. He’s of African-American ancestry. While his net worth is unknown, he did sign a 7-figure endorsement deal with Nike in 2016.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=christian-coleman-twitter></span>Christian Coleman Twitter<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tweets by __coleman</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJuYp7a0wMiapWabn6Gyrq3NZpmip12WtKZ5kGlnpmWknrqmec2eq2avn6fBqXnAp5tmrKeewbWx0WZpaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./coming-out-of-the-dark-singer-who-with-her-husband-emilio-won-the-2019-gershwin-prize-2-wds.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Coming Out of the Dark singer who with her husband Emilio won the 2019 Gershwin Prize: 2 wds.">&larr;
