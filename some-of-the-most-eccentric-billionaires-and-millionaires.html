Surprisingly, some of the richest people in the world have the strangest lifestyles – instead of owning private jets and mansions – they may choose to live in a modest home with few valuables, unlike most celebrities who feel the need to compete with one another. This brings us to the point to say that you can't judge a book by its cover – you never know what extravagant idea is on the bucket list of the rich and famous. Here is a list of some eccentric millionaires and billionaires who seem to lead very odd lives.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-168262 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-126106038.jpg alt="Justin Sullivan/Getty Images" width=900 height=674 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-168262 class=wp-caption-text>Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</p><p><strong><a href=# title="Mark Zuckerberg Net Worth">Mark Zuckerberg</a></strong></p><p>Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg hasn't let his massive fortune give him a big head. With a nerdy demeanor, he remains quiet and reserved, living in a modest yet still luxurious home, wearing inexpensive clothes and just acting like an all-around normal human being – biggest difference is that he is a billionaire who could buy his own island! What's most eccentric about him (besides the fact that he hasn't bought his own island) is his Facebook post of&nbsp;May 2011: "I just killed a pig and a goat." Meanwhile Zuckerberg was supposedly a vegetarian. He's reportedly terminated his flesh-eating ways since 2012.</p><p><strong>Graham Pendrill</strong></p><p>It's too bad that society views a major charitable act as odd. Graham Pendrill, a 57-year-old millionaire antiques dealer, donated all his money to charity. The eccentricity doesn't stop there – Pendrill moved to Kenya to live in a mud hut after helping a tribe solve its dispute. Leaving his shiny suit behind, he now wears a robe and sandals as the only white man to ever be initiated into the tribe, even referred to as the "Brave One."</p><p><strong><a href=# title="Nicolas Berggruen Net Worth">Nicolas Berggruen</a></strong></p><p>Another wealthy person who makes our list due to his generosity is Nicolas Berggruen, a billionaire philanthropist and investor. He sold all of his material possessions – even his luxurious mansion – leaving his fortune to charities. Reportedly, his motive for his giving was simply because he was tired of possessing things and lost all interest. Berggruen spends his days exploring the world and staying in hotels.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;<a href=# title="Jocelyn Wildenstein Net Worth">Jocelyn Wildenstein</a></strong></p><p>Plastic surgery seems to be a hot commodity amongst celebrities in every industry. For swiss socialite Jocelyn Wildenstein, she went overboard by spending a fortune on plastic surgery to create an image of a cat-like woman, which she thought would please her ex-husband Alec Wildenstein. Apparently, he eventually grew tired of her obsession with it, as he was caught cheating with another woman in their bed. Her divorce resulted in a huge settlement of $2.5 billion, with an additional $100 million per year for 13 years. However, ironically, the judge ruled that she couldn't use the money for any other plastic surgeries.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-168261 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/GettyImages-102129763.jpg alt="Getty Images" width=900 height=602 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-168261 class=wp-caption-text>Getty Images</p><p><strong><a href=# title="Richard Branson Net Worth">Richard Branson</a></strong></p><p>There aren't too many billionaire's on this planet. Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group, is one of few who believes in the impossible – planning to turn his odd dreams into reality with his new creation Virgin Galactic. For a sum of $200,000, he plans to allow travelers to visit space. Ultimately, his goal is to craft a space resort, building hotels in the final frontier. Unfortunately, the regular people won't be able to witness this masterpiece unless they win the lottery! That too, may not even be enough.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLHNrZyrrJGeu66xza1kmqqknrCtsdJonJyblaPBs7XCZpmipJyevK%2BtyKucrGWdnrmttc6nmKKqlah8</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./soothe-to-sleep-as-a-baby.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Soothe to sleep as a baby">&larr;
