So far she has won critical acclaim from Rolling Stone, The LA Times, and was named one of CMT’s Next Women of Country and all before the release of her debut album. Her first record ‘Get Drunk And Cry’ will be released later this year!</p><p>Here we speak exclusively to Ruthie about her musical inspirations, the UK country scene, debut album and much, much more;</p><p><strong>Growing up what or who inspired your love of country music?</strong><br>I fell in love with 90’s country when I was in middle school. It was a beautiful time to fall in love. Garth Brooks, Jo Dee Messina, Trisha Yearwood, there were all these amazing artists and songs being played on the radio. Great stories with depth and great melodies. After that I was hooked!</p><p><strong>Who are your all time musical icons?</strong><br>I am a fan of true singer/songwriters. I love Tom Petty, Patty Griffin, Ryan Adams. Also a big fan of Emmylou Harris, Dolly Parton and Miranda Lambert.</p><p><strong>If you could collaborate with any artist who would you choose?</strong><br>Wow such a tough question! I would love to write with Patty Griffin, if only to see how the inside of her brain works while writing a song. But Dolly or Emmylou would be a huge honor as well. These are women whose art has really stood the test of time. And that’s what I’m trying to do.</p><p><strong>You were recently named by CMT as one of their Next Women Of Country, how does that make you feel?</strong><br>I was so honored and humbled to be named one of CMT’s Next Women of Country. I was standing on stage with Kelsea Ballerini, Cam, Lindsay Ell, Claire Dunn and Broke Eden so the company I was keeping was quite exceptional! I am so thankful to Leslie Fram and everyone at CMT for fighting the good fight for us ladies.</p><p><strong>Country is growing in Britain&nbsp;as well, are you plugged into the UK country scene?</strong><br>I think it’s amazing how much love country music is getting over there. The UK is a place that still puts so much value on good music and they really recognize it. I VERY MUCH look forward to being able to tour in the UK!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Your new album ‘Get Drunk And Cry’ will be released this year, what can fans expect from the record?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br>This record is really very honest. Every song on the record is one that I wrote, and a true emotion that I experienced. Bad or good times, it’s all honest. Fans can expect more of what I’m always aiming for: Real country music, mixed in with modern production and thoughtful lyrics.</p><p></p><p><strong>What is the main theme running through your new LP?</strong><br>I’ve personally been through a lot in the last few years. A lot of growing up, a lot of heartbreak and big relationship changes. This record reflects all that. I think it’s the journey of a girl realizing that she isn’t defined by any one else, especially not by a relationship, and that it’s OK&nbsp;to be happy and to be alone. But to always believe that love could be right around the corner. :)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Do you plan on touring your new music?</strong><br>Yes! We will start the radio tour very soon so we will be all over the place! I can’t wait to get back out on the road!</p><p><strong>What do you hope to achieve over the next ten years?</strong><br>I can’t wait to be out on the road playing my music with my amazing band who are my best friends. I live for writing songs. It’s in my blood and I sometimes I can’t stop myself so there will be a lot of that. There will be more records, more TV I’m sure because that’s a really fun side to this business. And most of all, I want to hear my music on country radio. It’s going to be a wild ride and I can’t wait!</p><p>Make sure you follow Ruthie Collins on Twitter <a href=#>@ruthie_collins</a> to keep up to date with all her latest music and tour news!</p><p><strong>Did you enjoy our exclusive interview with Ruthie Collins?
