Looking back at her pictures over the years, some of Nicola’s facial features do appear to have changed significantly.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The daughter of a billionaire and a model, Nicola no doubt inherited some of her mother’s good looks.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Something To Talk About</h2><p>Nicola is a model and actress and has been in stage, film, and television productions throughout her short acting career so far.</p><p>Although she started out as a child actress among <a href=# rel=noopener>heavyweights such as Jeff Daniels and Campbell Scott</a>, she didn’t hit it big until 2010’s ‘The Last Airbender’.</p><p>Her physical looks in the film sparked some controversy by fans of the animated series, as her character was supposed to be Inuit, yet Nicola is obviously caucasian.</p><p>This was among the first, and most probably not the last time that comments would be made about Nicola’s appearance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Acting Career</h2><p>Nicola continued to expand her acting chops by snagging roles to <a href=# rel=noopener>star opposite the likes of Danny DeVito and Matthew Broderick in the holiday movie ‘Deck The Halls’</a> in 2006.&nbsp;</p><p>She later landed the character of Mark Wahlberg’s daughter in the fourth installment of the ‘Transformers’ franchise, ‘Age of Extinction’.</p><p>Nicola was cast to appear in the television series ‘Bates Motel’ where she played the character, Bradley Martin, from 2013.&nbsp;</p><p>Although her role was downgraded from main cast member to recurring guest star, <a href=# rel=noopener>she remained with the series until the third season</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Transformation</h2><p>Nicola’s rising star has created many opportunities for her to be photographed in public. In addition to her career as a movie star and model, she has been linked to other high profile people in her dating life.</p><p>Her obvious <a href=# rel=noopener>transformation has been the topic of conversation</a> for a number of years now.</p><p>According to self-styled experts, between 2010 and 2018, Nicola Peltz has completely modified her appearance, from her make-up choices to hair color to the shape of her face.</p><p>Nicola has changed her hair going from brunette to a mix between dirty and sandy blonde; achievable by a simple visit to a hair salon.</p><p>More drastic changes have been perceived in the shape of <a href=# rel=noopener>Nicola’s chin, her lips and her nose</a>. These changes are thought to have totally altered the starlet’s overall appearance, so much so that she is said to look like a completely different person.</p><p>According to one source, <a href=# rel=noopener>Nicola has received lip fillers</a> to make her upper lip fuller and more uniform with her bottom lip, which is naturally full.&nbsp;</p><p>More invasive surgery in the form of a possible jaw shaving or fillers in order to round out her jaw and chin, which was <a href=# rel=noopener>previously more heartshaped</a>, is also speculated.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>One And The Same</h2><p>Nicola Peltz’s star is still rising. She has appeared in music videos, has walked runways for fashion giants, and continues to act on both the small and big screens.</p><p>These are all opportunities for the rest of the world to see her face and bear witness to her transformation if there should be more.</p><p>Although critics have said that Nicola no longer looks like herself, as in, the person to whom the world was first introduced, one thing that is not in question is that she is a beautiful woman.</p><p>Regardless of her choices for the future, one thing which can be said is that she is likely to always be talked about.</p><p>Nicola Peltz will continue to be admired, criticized, and speculated about as people continue to be fascinated by her beauty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jqGYrGWenrCwuMBmp56kpK96qa3DZqelmaOptqR50q6poJ2irnw%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-australian-personality-natalie-tran-married-or-is-she-engaged-to-her-boyfriend-know-more-about-h.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Australian Personality Natalie Tran Married Or Is She Engaged to Her Boyfriend?
