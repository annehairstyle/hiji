Sometimes, the regret is instantaneous, but more likely, you found out later that what you did was offensive or nasty in some way. Celebrities do this constantly, and since they are in the public eye, everyone gets to read or hear about their gaffe. And just like us, sometimes they apologize and sometimes they don’t. I guess we can consider ourselves lucky than when we screw up verbally, the whole world doesn’t know about it. The following stars have express themselves publicly and had to eat (or should have eaten) humble pie afterwards.</p><p><strong>Freddy Prinze Jr. – should regret it<br></strong></p><p>It was just reported that the late 90’s heartthrob almost quit acting after working with Kiefer Sutherland, who Prinze Jr. deemed the “most unprofessional dude in the world.” The 38-year-old actor told ABC News&nbsp;said that he “hated every moment” of working on 24 due to the show’s star.&nbsp;<span>Prinze’s stint on the show was (thankfully?) short-lived stint. Freddy said that he would say these things to Sutherland’s face, so he most likely won’t be apologizing. But he could have risen above it and not made those harsh comments so publicly.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Kanye West</strong></p><p>This was the quote heard ‘round the world! Kanye stated while presenting during the 2005 Hurricane Katrina benefit that aired world wide that then-President “George Bush doesn’t care about black people.” No one will ever forget the look on comedian Mike Meyers’ face, who presenting alongside Kanye, when the rapper uttered those now-infamous words.</p><p><strong>Paula Deen</strong></p><p>The 66-year-old Savannah kitchen celebrity was swamped in controversy in June 2013. Court documents revealed that Deen told an attorney questioning her under oath last month that she made a number of racial remarks. “Yes, of course,” Deen said on tape, though she added, “It’s been a very long time.” The Food Network&nbsp;took this image issue very seriously, and dumped her from their programming. This came barely an hour after the celebrity cook posted the first of two videotaped apologies online begging forgiveness from fans and critics.</p><p><strong>Jonah Hill</strong></p><p>The lovable funny man called a papparazzo a slur but apologized for it profusely.&nbsp;“I’m not at all defending my choice of words, but I am happy to be the poster boy for thinking about what you say and how those words, even if you don’t intend them and how they mean, they are rooted in hate.&nbsp; And I shouldn’t have said that,” Hill told Howard Stern during an on-air interview.&nbsp;The&nbsp;22 Jump Street&nbsp;actor actively and publicly supports gay rights and even&nbsp;took a stand against Russia’s anti-gay stance&nbsp;during the Olympics. “It would break my heart to think that anyone would think, especially with all the work that I’ve done, that I would be against anyone for their sexuality,” he continued. I think Jonah is forgiven. This time.</p><p><strong>Donald Trump&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Trump suggested that President Obama was a “bad student” who probably didn’t deserve to be admitted to the Ivy League universities he attended (Columbia and Harvard). Trump also suggested that perhaps Obama wasn’t truly a United States citizen. Amazingly, the White House followed up by releasing the POTUS’s birth certificate to the public, which proved that he was born in Honolulu, Hawaii.</p><p><strong>Kanye West (again!)</strong></p><p>Remember when the self-proclaimed messiah of hip-hop bum-rushed the stage after Taylor Swift was awarded an MTV Music Video Award in 2009? Of course you do. He grabbed the award and stated, to paraphrase, that it was ridiculous that Beyonce hadn’t won. That’s cold. He later issued a grovelling, rambling, 72-tweet apology, which Swift didn’t respond to.</p><p><strong><span>Mel Gibson</span></strong></p><p>First off, Gibson creating and directing The Passion of the Christ, which many considered to have strong anti-Semitic tones. But to add fuel to the fire, Mel went on a drunken tirade in 2006 consisting of a anti-Semitic rant in which he blamed Jews for every war going and said horrible things about Jews. The actor later apologized to everyone in the Jewish community but it was most definitely a little too late for almost everyone.</p><p>(Photo by Jemal Countess/Getty Images)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwMieqmavmKTDpnnGqKafnZRivLN5w6ilnmWYlr%2B0tIytn6Kml6h6scHBpaCcpKlk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./chicago-area-chef-and-restaurateur-dies-at-99-the-talks-today.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chicago Area Chef and Restaurateur Dies at 99 The Talks Today">&larr;
