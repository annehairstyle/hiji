Their story began decades ago when they were 15. According to the sport's veteran, Stamaton knows him best and can confidently say she hasn't seen him eat a vegetable since their meeting. Stamaton <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://heavy.com/sports/2017/10/al-michaels-wife-linda-family-age-net-worth-kids/>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"Since the day I met him—when I was 15 years old—he never had a vegetable. Not even a salad. When he was a baby, you know how you don't want your vegetables? I think his mother let him get away with it."</p><p class=dh>Nevertheless, Michaels stays healthy for his wife in other ways. He eats all kinds of fruits and takes vitamins for nutrition. Although Stamaton has different interests, she learned to love the same things as her husband, including sports.

At that time, the pair had just tied the knot in 1966.</p><p class=dh>They worked in close proximity to allow more time spent together apart from being at home. Two years later, the couple relocated to Hawaii, where Michaels called games for the Pacific Coast League's Hawaii Islanders baseball team and the University of Hawaii.</p><p class=dh>His career eventually brought him to Cincinnati and San Francisco until he signed with ABC Sports in 1977.
