Taj George is best known as one-third of the&nbsp;R&B&nbsp;singing group Sisters with Voices (SWV).</span></h3><h2><span id=Early_Life>Early Life</span></h2><p><strong>Taj George</strong> was born on<strong> April 29, 1971,</strong> in Brooklyn, New York, in the United States of America. She is <strong>51 years old</strong> and holds American citizenship. Meanwhile, she has a zodiac sign of Leo and belongs to the American ethnicity.</p><p>Talking about her early childhood life, parents, and siblings, there is no accurate details information available . Sadly, her father died of pancreatic cancer when she was nine. After that, she grew up in an abusive household; her mother, who was sick with bone cancer, was beaten regularly by her drug-addicted stepfather.</p><p>While George tried to help her mother, she was abused as well. When George was 14, her mother died, and she and her siblings were divided among several relatives; George wound up with a cousin who molested her, adding to the sexual abuse she had endured from other male relatives over the years.</p><h2><span id=Taj_George_8211_Education>Taj George – Education</span></h2><p>Talking about her academic career, she completed her high school education at a local high school near her hometown. After that, she attended Baruch College to study accounting but left college because of a physically abusive boyfriend. She went to Belmont University in Nashville and completed her Bachelor of Business Administration in May 2004.</p><h2><span id=Professional_Career>Professional Career</span></h2><h4><span><span id=SWV class=mw-headline>SWV</span></span></h4><p>Taj George joined into SWV (then known as Female Edition) by Cheryl “Coko” Gamble and later became SWV’s lead singer. She was so nervous that she auditioned with the lights off.&nbsp; George is popular as the background dancer/model in Big Daddy Kane’s “Ain’t No Half Steppin” music video and has a bubbly, upbeat personality. This annoyed George and Gamble, who did believe Taj’s recognizable face and cheerful demeanor shielded her from press criticism.</p><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-316735 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographymask.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Taj-George-performing-in-concert.jpg alt="Taj George " width=650 height=488 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-316735 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Taj George performing in concert (Source: Wikipedia)</p><p>George was originally a singer as well as an emcee; she can be heard rapping the bridge over the original version of Right Here and I’m So Into You, and she is the primary female performer on the song Blak Pudd’n. She co-wrote several SWV songs, including Right Here from their debut album, It is About Time, and You’re the One, on which Gamble also collaborated.</p><p>When New Beginning was released in 1996, shortly after the end of the new jack swing era, George stopped rapping and began singing leads (It’s All About U, Give It Up) and co-leads (Lose My Cool, Use Your Heart). SWV went on to sell more than 20 million albums, making them one of the best-selling girl groups of all time.</p><h4><span>Post-career after SWV</span></h4><p>In the year 1998, the SWV group officially split. George signed a two-year contract with the Ford Modeling Agency. After this contract ended, she started dating Tennessee Titans running back Eddie George, whom she’d met at a shopping mall in 1994. Moreover, she contributed to the anthology Souls of My Sisters: Black Women Break Their Silence, Tell Their Stories, and Heal Their Spirits, which was published in 2000.</p><p>In 2007, she co-wrote a book named “Player hateHER: How to Avoid the Beat Down and Live in a Drama-Free World” with Katrina Chambers.&nbsp; The same year, she and her husband Eddie appeared in the reality TV show&nbsp;I Married a Baller, which depicted five weeks in the George household throughout nine shows.</p><h4><span>Survivor</span></h4><p>She appears in the American version of the International Survivor reality competition “Survivor” after answering a casting call specifically looking for an NFL wife. In the competition, she proved she was one of the strongest competitors of the season and came in second to J.T. Thomas in the fan favorite vote.</p><h2><span id=Net_Worth_2023>Net Worth 2023</span></h2><p>Being a well-known American rapper, singer, and author, she has collected a good sum of money in her profession.
