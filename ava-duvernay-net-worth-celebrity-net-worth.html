Deal</strong></h2><p>In November 2018, DuVernay signed a $100 million multi-year exclusive production deal with Warner Bros.

Her biological father is Joseph Marcel DuVernay III, and she grew up in Lynwood with mother Darlene (an educator), stepfather Murray Maye, and four siblings. During the summers, Ava traveled to her father's childhood home near Selma, Alabama, which influenced the filming of "Selma." DuVernay attended Saint Joseph High School in Lakewood, graduating in 1990, then she majored in African-American studies and English literature at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>Originally interested in journalism, Ava didn't pick up a video camera until she was in her early thirties. She interned at CBS News, where she was assigned to assist with coverage of the O.J. Simpson murder trial. DuVernay told "UCLA Magazine" in 2012, "I was one of 10 interns who were dispatched to cover a juror. I was to sit outside the juror's house, look through trash and do all the things I thought were not becoming of a broadcast journalist. I became disenchanted with journalism, so I pivoted to publicity. My first job out of college was at a small studio as a junior publicist." Ava went on to work as a junior publicist at Savoy Pictures and 20th Century Fox before opening The DuVernay Agency in 1999. In 2005, she decided to use $6,000 to make her first short film, "Saturday Night Life," and it was featured on Showtime's "Black Filmmaker Showcase" in February 2007. Next, DuVernay directed and produced the 2007 documentary short "Compton in C Minor," followed by the full-length documentary "This is the Life" in 2008. In 2010, she released the film "I Will Follow," which was inspired by her experience as a caregiver for her aunt, Denise Sexton, and cost $50,000 to make. After "I Will Follow," Ava left her job as a publicist, then she made the 2012 film "Middle of Nowhere," which earned her the Directing Award at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival. The Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture recruited DuVernay to make a movie about African-American history, and "August 28: A Day in the Life of a People" premiered at the museum's opening in September 2016.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-247086 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/GettyImages-905418442.jpg alt="Ava DuVernay Net Worth" width=594 height=399 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-247086 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><p>In 2014, Ava directed "Selma," a drama about the Rev.
