That 24-15 victory wasn’t enough to move Michigan ahead of Ohio State or Georgia, but kept them firmly entrenched in the top four.</p><p>After waiting a long time for their first test, the Wolverines got a big one, playing a talented Penn State team on the road the day after Jim Harbaugh was suspended. They stayed unbeaten and will have a case to be No. 1 if they win their next two games against Maryland and Ohio State.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Don't sleep on No. 16 Iowa</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Don't sleep on No. 16 Iowa" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">Jeffrey Becker / USA Today</p><p>People might scoff at Iowa climbing up to No. 16 but the Hawkeyes generated more than 400 yards in a game for the first time since 2021 in a 22-0 win against Rutgers. Iowa has allowed one touchdown in the last four games and has won 13 of its last 16 games.</p><p>It might not be picturesque, but the Hawkeyes’ style of play is effective. They’ve already clinched a share of the Big Ten West title and will earn a trip to Indianapolis with a win against either Illinois or Nebraska.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">This was what I expected to happen</h2><p>Georgia deserved to jump Ohio State after the blowout win over Ole Miss, but again this ranking doesn’t mean much for the Buckeyes. Ohio State still has one of the best resumes in the country, but the matchup in Ann Arbor on Nov. 25 is going to determine whether the Buckeyes or Michigan get into the College Football Playoff.</p><p>Fortunately for Ohio State it seems to be playing its best football of the season right now, even despite being jumped in the rankings by Georgia. Everything is in front of Ohio State. Beat Minnesota on Saturday and then The Game. Those are the most important things for the Buckeyes right now, the rankings just mean Ohio State controls its own destiny.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">This feels important for Georgia</h2><span><span></span><img alt="This feels important for Georgia" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">Dale Zanine / USA Today</p><p>As jaded as Georgia's fans and program have become about these rankings, having been through this experience long enough, this feels important. First off, it's a good reward for how the Bulldogs have played lately. More importantly, it's setting them up to survive a loss down the stretch.</p><p>Enough committee members clearly value what Kirby Smart's team has done on the field, against a schedule that looks better than it did at the start of the season. That'll make it harder for Georgia to free-fall out of the top four if it does lose, either this weekend at Tennessee or in the SEC championship against Alabama. (A loss at unranked Georgia Tech in between would be harder to take.)</p><p>Much will still depend on what happens elsewhere, but the Bulldogs are now in a stronger position than they were two weeks ago.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Committee made the right call</h2><p>The committee made the right call in sliding Georgia up to the No. 1 spot now that the Dawgs have two of the best wins of any contender (over Mizzou and Ole Miss).</p><p>The only qualm I have about the top six is that Washington remains behind Florida State — despite a stronger resume that includes a win over No. 6 Oregon. I’m surprised that hasn’t changed in any iteration of the rankings so far this season, especially this week as we see the selection committee make an adjustment at No. 1 for a similar reason.</p><p class="slug ad-slug">Advertisement</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Georgia takes the top spot</h2><li>Georgia (10-0)</li><li>Ohio State (10-0)</li><li>Michigan (10-0)</li><li>Florida State (10-0)</li><li>Washington (10-0)</li><li>Oregon (9-1)</li><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">No. 10 through 7</h2><p>7: Texas (9-1)</p><p>8: Alabama (9-1)</p><p>9: Missouri (8-2)</p><p>10: Louisville (9-1)</p><span><span></span></span><p>ESPN reveals No. 25 through 16.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Penn State, Ole Miss remain in top 15</h2><p>Penn State and Ole Miss remain in the top 15, meaning beating those teams counts as a top-15 win.</p><p>Also, Iowa up to No. 16! Arizona up to No. 17!</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Team to watch this week</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Team to watch this week" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">USA Today</p><p>Louisville. The Cardinals should be in the top 10, and they have a trip to Miami on tap this weekend. Can they continue their magical first season under Jeff Brohm? That’s a big story line to watch this week.</p><p class="slug ad-slug">Advertisement</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Ranking the top G5 team?</h2><p>Of all G5 teams? James Madison. The Dukes are far and away the best team in the G5, and if the NCAA didn't want to punish teams for moving up in the world it would be guaranteed a New Year's Six berth. I still think having an aristocratic title as a mascot is antithetical for a university named after the Father of the Constitution, but this is about football, not logic.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">The top four</h2><span><span></span><img alt="The top four" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">USA Today</p><li>Georgia</li><li>Ohio State</li><li>Michigan</li><li>Washington</li><p>Georgia’s blowout of top-10 Ole Miss was impressive enough to reclaim the top spot. Ohio State or Michigan for No. 2 is a fair argument, but it’s tough to get too bent out of shape considering that one will sort itself out in a couple of weeks.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">This week's four at the top</h2><li>Georgia</li><li>Ohio State</li><li>Michigan</li><li>Washington</li><p>I had the Dawgs at No. 1 last week, but their defining win against Ole Miss has left no further debate. I'm bumping Washington into the top four after their third ranked win.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">No. 5 this week?</h2><p>Alabama is my No. 5 team because I think it would wipe the floor with Ohio State. Death, Taxes, Nick Saban teams peaking at the right time are the only certain things in life. How tedious.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Who do you have at No. 5?</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Who do you have at No. 5?" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">USA Today</p><p>Florida State. To no fault of its own because it has been consistently winning, but the resume leaves something to be desired. The Seminoles' best win is LSU, a three-loss team and their next best wins are a collection of four-loss teams: Clemson, Duke and Miami. Everything should work itself out for Florida State should it keep winning, but right now there are four teams with better wins.</p><p class="slug ad-slug">Advertisement</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Who's your No. 5 team?</h2><span><span></span><img alt="Who's your No. 5 team?" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">USA Today</p><p>Florida State was in my top four until I watched it against Miami and before Michigan took care of business against Penn State. The Seminoles struggled against Miami's offensive and defensive fronts more than they should have. But I'd still take them to beat Washington or Oregon at this point.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">Rank the best G5 team</h2><p>Tulane. The Green Wave are following the Cincinnati blueprint: marquee game against a college power in a New Year's Six Bowl the previous year then carry that momentum into the next. Tulane, sitting at 9-1, is positioned nicely for a late-season bump too. The AAC has three teams at 6-0 in the conference (including Tulane) and a 5-1 Memphis team. Tulane ends the year with one of the undefeated teams: UTSA before a conference championship game against another strong team. The quality of wins will be there to secure the coveted G5 spot in the New Year's Six.</p><span><span></span></span><h2 class="sc-f3dd6d06-15 kvzeDn">What team are you watching this week?</h2><span><span></span><img alt="What team are you watching this week?" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theathletic.com/data:image/gif;base64 decoding=async data-nimg=responsive style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class="sc-b636adb0-0 sc-f3dd6d06-23 fwmDuZ jeCHEZ">USA Today</p><p>THIS IS THUNDER-DAM.
