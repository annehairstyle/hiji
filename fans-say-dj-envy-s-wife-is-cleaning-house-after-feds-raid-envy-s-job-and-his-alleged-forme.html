The money that the Pinas received allegedly never went into those investments.</p><p><strong>Trending Today:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>‘Is Jamie Foxx a Better Actor Than Denzel?’: Social Media Is Having a Meltdown as Fans Are Forced to Choose Sides Between Two Iconic Actors</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=#>‘LAWD Let That Hurt Go Tyrese’: Singer Claims DJ Envy Cheated on His Wife with Up to 10 Women, Calls Him a ‘Gaslighter’ and ‘Manipulator’ In New Rant</a></li></ul><ul><li><a href=#>‘He’s Raising Me’: Mo’Nique Says She Calls Her Husband ‘Daddy’ Because Her Father Stopped Giving Her What She ‘Needed’ at 13</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Collage-Maker-19-Oct-2023-12-54-PM-5085-1-600x338.jpg><p>Envy, real name RaaShaun Casey, is involved in the case because many of the accusers claim that he was the one who connected them to the Pinas through publicity. The radio disc jockey had Pina as a guest on “<a href=#>The Breakfast Club</a> more than once, he spoke several seminars hosted by the Pinas, and he made dozens of social media posts supporting their business, “Flipping NJ,” which has him listed as a co-owner.</p><p>The 46-year-old nonetheless is denying any involvement with the Pinas, claiming that he was ignorant of any malpractice. He claims that he was wrongly included in the lawsuit because of his celebrity status and that his attorneys do not want him to speak on the matter, but on Oct. 11 he did just that.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>On “The Breakfast Club,” Envy said he did the seminars with Pina because he wanted to “uplift” his community by teaching others about generational wealth and how to buy homes online.</p><p>“I did these seminars and brought industry professionals to all these seminars,” he admitted. “Now Cesar, if he took money, I wasn’t privy to it, nor did I even know. But I do understand how people feel if they did give him money.”</p><p>He then claimed that he knows how Pina’s victims feel because he allegedly gave him “a lot of money” that he didn’t get a return on. “I never stole nothing from nobody, and I’ll leave it that,” Envy concluded.</p><p>Just days after this episode aired, <a href=#>Pina was arrested</a> by federal agents on one count of wire fraud charges. He pleaded not guilty, and he was later released on a $1 million bond. Pina has been placed on electronic monitoring, and cannot leave the state of New Jersey, as he could potentially face additional charges for money laundering.</p><p>In the <a href=#>complaint</a> to announce the charges, local U.S. Attorney Philip R. Sellinger said “Pina exploited celebrity status and social media to develop a devoted following of potential victims.”</p><p>It continued, “Promising returns that were too good to be true, Pina allegedly defrauded dozens of people of millions of dollars. Our office is committed to protecting the public from these schemes and prosecuting those who lie to investors for their own personal gain.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/atlantablackstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/pina.complaint.pdf-1-600x464.png><p>The statement claims Pina presented himself a “highly successful real estate investor, owned thousands of properties in multiple states, and had business relationships with numerous celebrities.”</p><p>An inside source also told <a href=#>NBC New York</a> that “the iHeartRadio offices were visited by the FEDS who took out electronic equipment as part of this investigation.”</p><p>Fans believe that it may be over for Envy, including one who said, “That statement from DJ Envy of him having to step away from the Breakfast Club for ‘personal reasons’ is right around the corner.” Another one added, “The Feds raid 105.1 about the DJ Envy RICO investigation & has arrested his associate??? It ain’t look good for bruh!”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The Feds raid 105.1 about the DJ Envy RICO investigation & has arrested his associate ???

While fans continue to wait for his statement or acknowledgment, others want to know if the “Biggest Boss” has heard the news yet.</p><p>Ross and Funk Flex helped popularized calling the case the “<a href=#>Real Estate RICO</a>,” during an eight-minute-long roast session where they clowned Envy for “selling the Statue of Liberty,” and “stealing old ladies’ houses.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>DJ envy wife cleaning her instagram in a desperate attempt to hide all the designer shit she used to post like the Feds are some local city operation and don’t already have that shit is HILARIOUS.</p>— Nobody (@supernobodyy) <a href=#>October 19, 2023</a><p>Fans claim that Envy’s wife, <a href=#>Gia Casey</a>, has since removed some of her posts that feature the dozens of luxury designer items Envy buys her throughout the year.
