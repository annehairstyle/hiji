Shane Hoskins, 30; Robert Demaio, 34, and Jacob Barroso, 30, all of whom were indicted in early March.</p><p>Police said some of the victims were roommates of those the crew targeted at clubs.&nbsp;</p><p>Ramirez, a social worker from Brooklyn, was last seen alive on surveillance footage leaving the Ritz Bar and Lounge, a gay club on West 46th Street, in a taxi with three men on April 21, 2022.</p><p>He was later found dead in the back of a taxi from a drug overdose, robbed of his phone and wallet.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Robert Demaio while being arraigned for his alleged role in the crimes. <span class=credit>Steven Hirsch</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Jacob Barroso during his arraignment. <span class=credit>Steven Hirsch</span></figure><p>“His cell phone was used to make numerous transfers from bank accounts and purchase sneakers,” NYPD Chief of Detectives James Essig told reporters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Nearly $20,000 was drained from his account using cash apps, such as Venmo and Paypal.</p><p>Four weeks later, Umberger, a DC political consultant, went missing after leaving The Q NYC, a gay nightclub at 795 Eighth Ave. He was found four days later on the fifth floor of an East 61st Street townhouse.</p><p>Like Ramirez, Umberger was robbed and about $25,000 was missing from his accounts.</p><p>Cops would later connect the two deaths through “similar fact patterns,” Essig said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Ramirez was found dead in the back of a taxi.</figure><p>Hamilton was caught on camera allegedly using both of the victims’ credit cards to make illegal purchases, the chief said.&nbsp;</p><p>The crew was also seen entering and leaving the townhouse where Umberger was found and driving off in a red Dodge Durango, which was rented to Demaio, according to Essig.</p><p>When cops arrested Demaio, they found two videos showing him, Hamiltonand an “apparently unconscious” Umberger lying in the same position as when cops would later find him dead, Essig said.&nbsp;</p><p>“In addition to the pain their deaths have caused for their family and loved ones, I know that many other New Yorkers have feared for their own safety when going out to meet up with friends,” Bragg said.&nbsp;</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Umberger died of a drug overdose after being robbed.</figure><p>“If other members of the public believe they have been the victims of similar incidents, I encourage them to call our help line at 212-335-9040.”</p><p>Sewell said joint work of cops and prosecutors on the case “crystallizes the NYPD’s commitment to bringing callous criminals to justice, particularly those who would turn illegal drugs into weapons to prey on the innocent.”</p><p>Hamilton appeared Tuesday afternoon in Manhattan Supreme Court where he pleaded not guilty to the indictment. A judge ordered him jailed without bail until his next court appearance June 8.</p><p>Additional reporting by Elizabeth Rosner</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j21manBflrmtscaem2aqmaO0rbHAnZyrZZGnv6a%2F056bZqGeYrCwus2emq2hn6N6tbuMp7CcZZeWxm66yKCfrZucqq9usNGunmaclZbBqb%2BO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./audien.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title=Audien>&larr;
