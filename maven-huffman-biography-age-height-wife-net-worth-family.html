He has not wrestled since 2016.</p><p>On July 11, 2015, Maven announced his return to pro wrestling. His return match took place at Brian Myers' Create A Pro Wrestling Academy in Long Island, New York on July 19, 2015. Maven teamed with Johnny Clash to defeat The Warren Cousins (Mikey Warren and TJ Warren) in his first match since 2007.</p><p>On September 26, 2015, Maven teamed with <a href=#>Brian Myers</a> in a losing effort against The Cam-An Connection (Anthony Greene and Cam Zagami).</p><p>In September 2013, Huffman was working as a bouncer in New York City.</p><p>On April 2, 2012, Huffman was arrested in Florida after police revealed that he was doctor shopping due to an addiction to oxycodone and hydrocodone. He was released on a $2,000 bond and faced up to 5 years in prison if convicted of doctor shopping. On April 11, Huffman revealed that he was seeking help for his addiction and underwent WWE's former talent rehabilitation program.</p><p>In March 2006, it was announced by VH1 that Huffman would be a participant in the sixth season of The Surreal Life. On the first episode, he was picked by the existing castmates as the seventh and final cast member in a "15 More Minutes of Fame Reality Hunk Pageant," beating four other reality "hunks", including former American Idol contestant <a href=#>Corey Clark</a>.</p><p>Following this, Maven began feuding with <a href=#>Shelton Benjamin</a> over Benjamin's Intercontinental Championship, culminating at New Year's Revolution 2005 in a singles match for the title. Before the start of the match, Maven proceeded to blast the Puerto Rican crowd before Benjamin quickly defeated him in just a matter of seconds by using a roll-up. Maven then cut a promo on Benjamin, stating that the match "didn't count", and challenged him to a re-match. Benjamin accepted, and Maven was defeated in only seconds yet again following the T-Bone Suplex.</p><p>At WrestleMania 21, Maven competed in a 30-man Interpromotional battle royal which was won by Booker T. Following his feud with Benjamin, Maven formed a tag team with Simon Dean, where he acted as a dedicated user of Dean's "Simon System" brand of nutritional products. After being jobbers for a month, at Backlash (2005), Maven and Simon Dean competed in a Tag Team Turmoil match for the World Tag Team Championship which was won by The Hurricane and Rosey. the team came to an end when Dean was traded to the SmackDown! brand while Maven was subsequently released by WWE on July 5, 2005.</p><p>On November 19, 2005, Maven wrestled his first match following his WWE departure, where he lost to <a href=#>Slyck Wagner Brown</a> via disqualification in a match for NWA Cyberspace.

After wrestling sporadically for the UWF and in dark matches for TNA throughout the year, Maven wrestled his final match on October 5, 2007, where he lost to Test in a match for Full Throttle Wrestling.</p><p>In July 2005, Huffman was featured in episode three of MTV's The 70s House where he along with other WWE wrestlers competed in a game of dodge ball.</p><p>Maven entered the 2003 Royal Rumble. He attempted to eliminate <a href=#>The Undertaker</a> by using a dropkick like he did the previous year, but failed and was eliminated by <a href=#>The Undertaker</a>. Maven fought World Heavyweight Champion Triple H on the March 10 of Raw, but lost. In 2004, Maven received the biggest push in his career, even gaining a victory over then-Evolution member Batista. Maven then took part in an Elimination Match at Survivor Series, teaming with Randy Orton, Chris Benoit, and <a href=#>Chris Jericho</a> to face Triple H, Batista, <a href=#>Gene Snitsky</a>, and Edge for the power to control Raw for one month. Maven was attacked backstage by Snitsky prior to the match, but after Benoit was eliminated, Maven arrived to join his teammates. He was eventually eliminated by Triple H. Orton was the sole survivor and as a result, he and his team had control of Raw for one month.</p><p>On the October 4 episode of SmackDown!, Maven made his in-ring debut against Tazz, one of his Tough Enough trainers, who forced him to submit to the Tazzmission. Following the match, Tazz helped Maven to his feet before clotheslining him, thus starting a feud between the two. After losing to Tazz via submission in a rematch the following week on SmackDown!, Maven clotheslined Tazz following the match. On the October 18 episode of SmackDown!, Maven won his first wrestling match as he defeated Tazz with assistance from Tough Enough co-winner <a href=#>Nidia Guenard</a>. Following this brief feud, Maven began a feud with <a href=#>The Undertaker</a> after he eliminated Undertaker from the 2002 Royal Rumble by dropkicking him from behind; Undertaker responded in turn by returning to the ring and eliminating Maven from the Royal Rumble match by tossing him over the top rope. He proceeded to hit him with a steel chair, and beating him all the way back to the concession stand area.</p><p>On the January 28, 2002 episode of Raw, Maven was awarded a title bout by WWF co-owner Ric Flair against <a href=#>Chris Jericho</a> for the Undisputed Championship by virtue of never actually being eliminated from the Royal Rumble, but lost after submitting to the Walls of Jericho. After the match, Maven was attacked by <a href=#>The Undertaker</a>. On the February 7 episode of SmackDown!, Maven faced Undertaker for his Hardcore Championship, and after interference from The Rock and his Tough Enough trainer Al Snow, Maven defeated Undertaker to win the Hardcore Title, the first championship of his career. Their feud ended after <a href=#>The Undertaker</a> defeated Maven and Al Snow in a 2-on-1 handicap match when <a href=#>The Undertaker</a> made Maven submit to the Dragon Sleeper. At WrestleMania X8, Maven lost the Hardcore Championship to <a href=#>Spike Dudley</a> during a match with Goldust due to the title's unique 24/7 rule, but won the title back the same night from Christian due to the same rule. Maven was the 10th pick for Smackdown in the WWE draft due to being the hardcore champion, but he was punished by Vince McMahon after he lost the belt to Raven. Maven was drafted to Raw on November 4, 2002 where he confronted <a href=#>Christopher Nowinski</a> with his former trainer Al Snow.</p><p>Huffman began his professional wrestling career in 2001 upon being selected to participate in the inaugural season of Tough Enough, a reality television show used by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) to find new WWF stars. Ultimately, Maven would become the co-winner of the competition alongside <a href=#>Nidia Guenard</a>, and he was sent to the Heartland Wrestling Association (HWA) to receive further training.</p><p>Maven Klint Huffman (born November 26, 1976) is an American professional wrestler, best known for his time with World Wrestling Entertainment under his first name.
