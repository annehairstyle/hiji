In the past, we've compared everything from <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>iced coffee</a> to <a href=# data-analytics-product-module=body_link rel>fried chicken</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are the contenders:</p><ul><li>McDonald's</li><li>Chick-fil-a</li><li>Subway</li><li>Starbucks</li><li>Panera Bread</li></ul><p>Advertisement</p><p>Keep reading to see who makes the best chocolate chip cookie.&nbsp;</p><h3>McDonald's</h3><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>McDonald's cookies come in packs of three. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Madeline Diamond/INSIDER</span></span></figure><p>McDonald's serves classic fast food cookies in packs of three. They were warm but not fresh out of the oven, and they had&nbsp;the perfect blend of crunch and chewiness. The chocolate was nothing revolutionary, although the overall taste and texture was&nbsp;exactly what we wanted from a cookie. These cookies also had the fewest&nbsp;calories of the group, at 170 calories per cookie and only 15 grams of sugar.</p><p>We paid $1.73 for three decent-sized cookies, which averages&nbsp;out to less than 60 cents per cookie. While w<span>e couldn't eat all of these&nbsp;in one sitting, they're perfect for sharing with friends or even saving for later.</span></p><h3><span>Chick-fil-A</span></h3><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Chick-Fil-A's cookie had a more homemade taste. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Madeline Diamond/INSIDER</span></span></figure><p>Chick-fil-A's cookie was the most unique of the group that we tested. It was more of a chocolate chip oatmeal cookie, and it was thicker and denser than the other competitors. At 350 calories, it was also&nbsp;one of the more caloric cookies of the bunch, but it was also the most complex and tasted almost&nbsp;homemade. This cookie was $1.62, which seemed fair in relation to its size.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The oatmeal element of this cookie had us excited, but overall, it left something to be desired. The texture was a bit too tough (making it hard to chew) and the flavor was on the bland side, so we ultimately weren't dying for more.</p><h3>Subway</h3><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Chocolate chip cookies from Subway are a cult favorite, but we felt something was a little off. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Madeline Diamond/INSIDER</span></span></figure><p>Aside from $5 foot longs, Subway is also pretty well-known for its chocolate chip cookies. We always hear people raving about them, so this was the one we were most excited to try. This cookie was also the cheapest of the five at just $0.76.</p><p>Unfortunately, Subway's cookie was by far the most artificial-tasting of the bunch. It was ultra-sweet and chewy, and the cookie&nbsp;was so thin that it didn't feel like there was much substance to it. It&nbsp;was also pretty greasy.</p><p>All those criticisms aside, we would have been fine with this cookie if it didn't have such a strange aftertaste. Somehow, the cookie ended up tasting like the Subway restaurant smelled&nbsp;<span>— it reminded us of the chain's Italian sandwich bread.</span></p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Needless to say, that's not what we're&nbsp;looking for in a chocolatey dessert, so this one was a disappointment.</p><h3>Starbucks</h3><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Look at those gooey chocolate chunks. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Madeline Diamond/INSIDER</span></span></figure><p>We loved the giant semi-sweet chocolate chunks in Starbucks' take on the chocolate chip cookie. This cookie tasted like it came from an actual bakery. It was chewy enough to almost fall&nbsp;apart when&nbsp;we picked it up, but substantial enough to be satisfying.</p><p>Despite its rich taste, the Starbucks cookie ranked somewhere&nbsp;in the middle in terms of calories and sugar. At 310 calories and 27 grams of sugar, this cookie is definitely a treat, although the cookies from Panera and Chick-fil-A were significantly more caloric.</p><h3>Panera Bread</h3><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>That's a big cookie. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Madeline Diamond/INSIDER</span></span></figure><p>Panera's Chocolate Chipper cookie is massive. Plus, it's filled with semi-sweet chocolate chunks&nbsp;and&nbsp;milk chocolate flakes. It came warm and had a freshly-baked taste, which we appreciated. Despite its impressive size, we were still a little put off by the price of $2.79, considering how much cheaper the other delicious cookies were.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Panera's cookie has a whopping 380 calories, the most of any of the cookies we tried, and 30 grams of sugar.</p><h3>The verdict</h3><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-only><span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>INSIDER/Madeline Diamond</span></span></figure><p>McDonald's cookies reigned supreme because they had the perfect combination of crunch and chewiness, and just the right amount of chocolate. Plus,&nbsp;$1.73 is a pretty good deal for three cookies.</p><p>Starbucks was a close second&nbsp;<span>— their cookie had a "fresh from the bakery taste" and&nbsp;giant chocolate chunks that we loved.</span></p><p><span>Panera's take on the chocolate chip cookie came in third because of its chewiness and ample chocolate chunks. However, it was a little too expensive.</span></p><p>Advertisement</p><p><span>Chick-fil-A had&nbsp;a different take on the chocolate chip cookie, which was interesting, but not what we wanted. It was also a little too dense&nbsp;</span><span>for our liking.</span></p><p><span>Subway, a fan favorite fast food cookie, came in last because of its artificial flavor and odd aftertaste.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSoqWeq6Oeu7S1w56pZ5ufony1tMRmmZ6rpGKzor%2FTZp2op5RisLC7yqKcZmpgZoRuhA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-shortest-celebrity-marriages-of-all-time.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Shortest Celebrity Marriages of All Time">&larr;
