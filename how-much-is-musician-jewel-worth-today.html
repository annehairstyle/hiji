The artist, who is known simply as ‚ÄúJewel‚Äù to fans, received multiple accolades in the music world. She is also an actor, author, and philanthropist. What is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jewel‚Äôs net worth</a> today?</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Jewel</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Singer-Songwriter, Actor, Author</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $14 million</p><p>Jewel is the stage name of Jewel Kilcher, who rose to fame in the mid-1990s with her debut album Pieces of You. That was one of the best-selling first albums and was certified 12 times platinum in the United States. Her career since then has included more studio albums, a Super Bowl national anthem performance, publishing several books and appearing in a variety of acting roles.</p><p><strong>Birth date:</strong> May 23, 1974</p><p><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Payson, UT</p><p><strong>Charities: </strong>Higher Ground for Humanity (founder), ReThink: Why Housing Matters (ambassador)</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jewel‚Äôs went from homeless teen to platinum-selling artist.</h2><p>Jewel has documented her life in detail in her memoir Never Broken, which was published in 2015. In her early childhood, Jewel was raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. She eventually received a partial scholarship to study at the Interlochen Arts Academy in Michigan.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span><p>Jewel spoke with her father Atz Kilcher at a 2019 conference.</p></figure><p>Jewel has spoken publicly about the struggles she faced as a teenager in Alaska, when she experienced <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">periods of homelessness</a>. For instance, at the 2017 SALT Conference in Las Vegas, she shared that while she was homeless, ‚ÄúPeople treated me like I was contagious.‚Äù</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jewel‚Äôs musical career started in San Diego, Calif.</h2><p>Like many famous musicians, Jewel grew up creating and playing music, and was ‚Äúdiscovered‚Äù at the age of 19 while playing in a San Diego coffee shop. She apparently dealt with a lot of fear when signing her first record contract, but released her debut album Pieces of You in 1995.</p><p>Although Pieces of You initially didn‚Äôt take off, a 1997 tour with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bob Dylan</a> brought the artist greater exposure and the album soon reached No. 4 on the U.S. Billboard 200. Her singles ‚ÄúWho Will Save Your Soul,‚Äù ‚ÄúFoolish Games,‚Äù and ‚ÄúYou Were Meant For Me‚Äù brought her popularity and critical acclaim. As of 2010, that debut album had sold 7.3 million copies in the U.S. and was certified a 12-time Platinum album.</p><p>Jewel‚Äôs recognition in her field includes three Grammy nominations and two MTV Video Music Awards nominations. She won the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MTV Video Music Award</a> for Best Female Video for her ‚ÄúYou Were Meant For Me‚Äù video.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jewel‚Äôs personal life includes one marriage, one son, and a lot of activism.</h2><p>Jewel briefly dated actor Sean Penn in the 1990s.
