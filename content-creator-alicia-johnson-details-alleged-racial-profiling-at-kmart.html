Which I did,” she said in the video.</p><p>“She then grabbed my receipt and read it in front of everybody. She had not checked the receipts of anyone else … I asked the staff member in front of everyone, ‘Why am I being checked?’</p><p>“A Māori lady was hurt for me. She then insisted that the staff member check her receipt in solidarity.”</p><p>The incident left Ms Johnson so “humiliated” and in “distress” that she called her mother after leaving the store.</p><p>“The first thing she said was, ‘Imagine if that happened to some young Indigenous girl. How traumatic would that be?’” she said.</p><p>“This is why I’m speaking out. This racial stereotyping has to stop and I’m requesting a formal apology.</p><p>“In 2022, Indigenous people should be treated with respect just like all other customers – paying ones at that.”</p><p>A Kmart spokeswoman told news.com.au in a statement that the retailer is “aware of an incident in our Marrickville store on Friday and have been in conversation with the customer to chat through this further”.</p><p>“We take reports like this extremely seriously and (are) investigating internally and organising a time to meet with the customer,” she added.</p><p>Researchers at Monash University, on behalf of Inclusive Australia, last May found that major discrimination against First Nations people remains at elevated levels.</p><p>The <a class=body-link href=# title=www.inclusiveaustralia.com.au>survey</a>, conducted over several years, looked at (among other things) “everyday discrimination”, defined as “more chronic, routine, and relatively minor experiences of unfair treatment”, like “being treated with less respect and courtesy, receiving poorer service than others at restaurants or stores, or being called names”.</p><p>Everyday discrimination was highest for Indigenous people among the groups surveyed, having risen dramatically since December 2018.</p><p>Providing an update on the situation on Sunday in a second <a class=body-link href=# title=www.instagram.com>video</a>, Ms Johnson said she had been contacted by Kmart and they had discussed the issue.</p><p>She also thanked “each and every single one” of her followers for supporting her in the wake of the incident.</p><p>“This is not an easy topic and one I do not speak about publicly, the degradation and abuse I’ve received in this country is something I deal with privately,” she wrote in the caption alongside the post.</p><p>Ms Johnson cited what her mother said to her as the reason “why I’m speaking” and “why I’m holding @kmartaus accountable”.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>“All the comments on the post of people sharing their testimony, is living proof of the racially discriminatory practices that are being upheld and enforced within their stores,” she added.</p><p>“I will continue to document this process, and share with you all what the outcomes will be and the next steps @kmartaus will put into action.</p><p>“I’m fighting for change. I’m fighting for freedom.”</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Sydney data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Sydney</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7y6Kdnqukrrmme9GemKVlnJ6zpnvNnq6sZZyes6Z7x66koqSZlsGmsIycpqeslaPBbq%2FRnpitp6Jirq21wqKYZqKfnbu0u81mm56skZ65tHnApaOen5WZerOtwqKYpWWgp7yntcuipaBlkal6rLnAq6toppWswG6%2F06ipsmdiZ4Wng5BqcJuZZmWyo4LAbm2emmlqgHKyknGYcW5hmw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./denny-zager-s-biography-net-worth-fact-career-awards-and-life-story.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Denny Zagers biography, net worth, fact, career, awards and life story">&larr;
