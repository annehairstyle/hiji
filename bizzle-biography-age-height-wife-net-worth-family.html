It opens with the rapper reciting a quotation from the Book of Timothy then leads into the same instrumental track as Macklemore's original. The song is critical of the media in its promotion of homosexuality, stating that it is hypocritical to call for tolerance for same-sex relationships while at the same time branding opponents of them as "hateful". He also takes offense at the analogy of gay rights with the civil rights struggle of blacks, He also encourages Christians who struggle with homosexuality to "fight the good fight".</p><p>On February 11, 2014, US Magazine reported that Justin Bieber had changed his Instagram handle to 'bizzle' citing that "the moniker ‘Bizzle’ actually belongs to a Christian rapper based in L.A."</p><p>On May 7, 2013, Bizzle released his second studio album The Good Fight. The album features production-works from Grammy-winning producer Boi-1da. Originally set for an April 26, 2013 release, it was pushed-back to a later date. Its first single, "Soldier" was released January 26, 2013 and features <a href=#>No Malice</a> and included a music video. Later singles were "Dear Hip-Hop" and "My Confession" (featuring Sevin). The album debuted on the Billboard Top Rap Albums at No.&nbsp;11. His previous works with Boi-1da include "Forgive Me" released on March 16, 2011 which features rapper MC Jin and "Lost and Found" on his collaborative mixtape Martyrs in the Making with <a href=#>Bumps Inf</a>.</p><p>Bizzle received nominations for Rap/Hip Hop Gospel CD of The Year at both the 2012 & 2014 Stellar Awards, sharing the category with artists <a href=#>Derek Minor</a>, Lecrae, and Thi'sl. He also received three nominations at the 2012 & 2013 Kingdom Choice Awards and although he didn't win any in 2012, he won all three categories in 2013 for Rap Single of The Year, Hip Hop Album of The Year, and Music Video of The Year.</p><p>On February 7, 2012 Felder and <a href=#>Willie Moore</a>, Jr. released Best of Both Worlds: The Album. They hit No. 5 spot on the iTunes Hip Hop/Rap Chart on their debut.</p><p>Bizzle stated that Boi-1da reached out to him on YouTube stating his personal beliefs in Christianity and respect for Bizzle's work and worked free of charge. The collaborative work between the two was highlighted in the 2012 September edition of XXL.</p><p>Bizzle released his debut album, Tough Love & Parables, on June 21, 2011 which debuted at No. 15 on the Billboard Gospel Albums chart. It appeared on the iTunes Store swoosh= banner. The Good Fight was released on May 7, 2013 and debuted at No.&nbsp;2 on Billboard's Gospel Albums chart, No.&nbsp;7 on Christian Albums, No.&nbsp;11 on Top Rap Albums, and sold a total of 3,962 copies in its first week.</p><p>On June 21, 2011, Felder released his first full-length studio album titled Tough Love & Parables.</p><p>In January 2010, Bizzle released "You Got Some Explaining to Do" directed towards Jay-Z, calling the rap icon out on his negative references towards Jesus and Christianity in his music. The video caused much controversy and generated a buzz that even Bizzle couldn't anticipate. He released a statement in an interview with AllHipHop.com.</p><p>He released his first mixtape, The Messenger, in March 2010. Shortly after the release, he founded God Over Money Records in Houston, Texas. Since its creation, the label has released eight mixtapes, a collaborative album with artist Willie 'P-Dub' Moore Jr., three full-length studio albums, and signed two artists.</p><p>The influence of his Christianity and Mark's exposure to the dark side of hip hop ultimately prompted his questioning of the dark imagery that appears to be promoted through the music of rappers like Kanye West,Rick Ross, and Jay-Z. On January 17, 2010 he released the track "You Got Some Explaining to Do", a song directed towards Jay-Z, exposing him for his negative references towards Jesus in his lyrics. The result of the diss song led Bizzle to being called the "Christian Rapper that dissed Jay Z". Overwhelmed by the positive response and media attention he received, Mark decided to set out making music that both proclaimed the Gospel of the Bible as truth and exposes the evil working within the music industry.</p><p>He released his first Christian mixtape, The Messenger, on March 30, 2010 on DatPiff. The mixtape received much success and has been downloaded over 1 million times since its release. The Messenger 2: Delivered & The Messenger 3: Truth Music followed in 2010 & 2011 respectively.</p><p>In 2005 he was offered a deal by 360 Records out of Houston and declined. Two years later, Bizzle had been offered a deal by Barry Hankerson to sign with Blackground/Universal, but he also declined that offer.</p><p>Between the years 2004–2008 Bizzle released 'L.A.V. Mixtapes' Volume's 1–5 in Southern California. He then released 'Dirty West Mixtapes' 1 and 2 with 360 Records in Houston, Texas, and returned to California to release his biggest yet, 'Certified Mixtape'.</p><p>Mark Julian Felder (born July 21, 1983), more commonly known under the simply Bizzle, is an American Christian hip hop recording artist and entrepreneur.</p><p>Bizzle caused a commotion in the media when he released Same Love: A Response, the artist's reaction to a controversial wedding ceremony broadcast during the 56th Annual Grammy Awards. As expected, the response track received a lot of media attention. Due to the extremely angry response Felder received, he created a website to draw attention to the apparent lack of tolerance toward Christians and their differing views on the definition of marriage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfl7a7xsue</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./breeze-through-nyt-crossword-answers.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Breeze (through) NYT Crossword Answers">&larr;
