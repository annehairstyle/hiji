She is also known as Reno Wilson’s partner.</h3><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Wilson, her husband, is well-known for his roles as Howard in the sitcom The Cosby Show, Officer Carl McMillan in Mike & Molly, Stan Hill in Good Girls, Wes in The Chronicle, and Detective Tom Selway in Blind Justice.

Find out how the pair has been able to keep their relationship going for so long.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The 29th of March is the day Fausone was born. She spent most of her childhood and teenage years dancing and choreographing, which she did while growing up in Silver Lake, LA, in the state of California.</p><p>Later in life, Patsi Simon’s daughter found employment instructing children in dance and cheerleading choreography, as well as movement. Gamynne Guillotte, who is Fausone’s sister, is a nomadic architect who received her education from the Southern California Institute of Architecture.</p><p>Coco is the first to admit that her desire for an active lifestyle stems more from her natural disposition than from any particular vocation. Running marathons, surfing, and snowboarding are three of her favorite activities, which she enjoys doing since they allow her to hone both her physical and mental strength.</p><p>In addition to that, Ms. Wilson is a swimming instructor. She enjoys nothing more than getting the spin room bouncing with hard-hitting sounds and R&B grooves. In addition to that, she is completely proficient in Spanish.</p><p>Santa Barbara City College was where Wilson’s wife got her education. In addition, she received a degree in communication from Los Angeles City College, which she attended. She left that institution with a diploma. In later years, Coco attended UCLA Extension to study Recording Engineering. She attended Alexander Hamilton High School in the past and graduated there.</p><p>Since 1997, the native of Los Angeles has worked in vocations related to dance and fitness, including cheer choreography for the Santa Barbara City College cheer team, dance instruction for Hamilton High, an episode of yoga choreography for the CBS show Mike and Molly, and personal goal tracking.</p><p>Other dance and fitness-related jobs include cheer choreography for the Santa Barbara City College cheer squad. Even Coco’s husband, Wilson, got into spinning thanks to Coco, and when she first started teaching, Wilson joined her in her lessons. Coco even introduced Wilson to the sport.</p><p>The fitness instructor who is fluent in two languages was offered her first significant role with the Warner Bros. Group of Entertainment Companies. In 2011, the media conglomerate recruited Fausone for a month to assist with a yoga scene that was going to be included in her husband’s program, Mike and Molly.</p><p>After that, over the subsequent six years, beginning in 2011, she worked as an instructor at YAS Fitness Center as well as designed athletic wear for the company.</p><p>The resident of the Eastside of Los Angeles launched her own business in January 2015, offering yoga lessons to clients in the comfort of their own homes. This was something that the mother of two did for around two years. She had been promoted to the position of Chief Financial Officer of Babe Wilson Entertainment the year prior, in 2014. Since then, Coco has been serving in that capacity.</p><p>Also Read: <a class=waffle-rich-text-link href=#>A Look At The Success And Relationships Of Joan- Baez</a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Celebrity</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Who Is Starla Baskett?
