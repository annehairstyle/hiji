While McMahon was forced to retire back in July last year, he came back last week. Right after that, McMahon became the Executive Chairman of WWE, shocking fans all over the world, after <a href=#>Stephanie McMahon stepped down and continued her leave away from WWE</a>. Eric Bischoff has extensively worked with Vince McMahon in his career and clearly has a lot of respect for him. In fact, Bischoff even stated that McMahon will always do what’s best for WWE’s ‘bottom line.’</p><p>Vince McMahon became the Executive Chairman of WWE after&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephanie McMahon’s exit</a>,&nbsp;and Nick Khan became the sole CEO of the company. Many fans simply couldn’t accept the fact Vince McMahon could continue to make tone-deaf decisions even now.</p><p>Vince McMahon had beef with many people over the years, which included the likes of Jeff Jarrett, The Ultimate Warrior, Goldberg and even Eric Bischoff. However, he eventually brought them all back to the company. He did so, because he knows what is best for business, and he was able to put those personal issues aside.</p><p>While speaking on his&nbsp;<a href=#>83 Weeks podcast</a>, Eric Bischoff talked about Vince McMahon’s most recent actions. Easy E stated that McMahon will always do what he feels is best for business and WWE’s ‘bottom line.’</p><p>“It’s us versus the bottom line is what it is. And I think if anybody’s proven publicly that that’s his method of operation, it’s Vince McMahon. He brought me back for crying out loud, or brought me in, forget about bringing me back. He brought me in the first time. Not because he liked me, not because of any other reason other than he thought it was best for business. It worked creatively, that’s all that mattered.</p><p>He probably hated my guts. He probably really wanted to stop me. It’s probably how he really felt about me, personally. But what was best for business at that moment? Look at Ultimate Warrior. Look at Jeff Jarrett, he brought Jeff Jarrett back. Yeah, Jeff Jarrett held up 350 grand or whatever it was, I don’t even know I didn’t pay attention to the story, but held him up for a significant amount of money, and brought him back. So I think Vince has demonstrated that what’s best for business is more important than how he feels about somebody personally.”</p><p><a href=#>There was already story that McMahon and Khan had a deal to sell WWE</a>, but that was eventually shut down by further reports. The reports stated that <a href=#>WWE has not been sold to Saudi Arabia</a>.</p><p>Vince McMahon will continue to do what he wants, and people in WWE will have to abide by every single decision he makes. We will have to wait and see whether McMahon will end up selling WWE to Saudi Arabia in the future. As of this writing, <a href=#>no official word has come out about this reported sale to Saudi Arabia</a>, but you never know what can happen in WWE.</p><p><strong>What’s your take on the Saudi Arabia deal?
