He has been active in a number of programs designed for school-age children and students. He has advocated for the mental health and justice of children in high school and middle school. His efforts and hard work are assisting hundreds of young people in establishing their well-maintained educational behaviors.</p><p>abriela López, Vice President Faauuga Moliga, and Commissioner Alison Collins. The recall attempt, on the other hand, is being funded by millionaires and billionaires, like Arthur Rock, who has contributed roughly $500,000 to the campaign.</p><h2><span id=Faauuga_Moliga-_Birth_Age_Ethnicity_Siblings_Education>Faauuga Moliga- Birth, Age, Ethnicity, Siblings, Education</span></h2><p>Faauuga Moliga is a San Francisco native and a graduate of the San Francisco Unified School District. He grew up in the San Francisco neighborhoods of Bernal Heights and Hunter’s Point, where he resided in public housing with his family. As a student at Paul Revere Elementary, he received firsthand knowledge about SFUD as well as many other schools such as Downtown High Continuation, Burbank Middle School, McAteer High School, John Adams, and, finally, Balboa High School. Later in life, as a parent of his children, he started to recognize the necessity of public education.</p><p>Moliga earned a bachelor’s degree in Justice Studies from San Jose State University. He had planned to become a lawyer when he was in college. He quit the school, however, after discovering that only five of the 55 Pacific Islanders at Burton had a GPA of 2.00 or higher. However, there was a shortage of assistance for Pacific Islander students, which pushed Moliga to establish TOUCH (Take Out Until Completely Healed). For at least six years, he directed a program aimed at assisting one hundred young women and achieving a college transition rate of at least 90% for all seniors.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table style=height:100%;width:100%><tbody><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Faauuga Moliga</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2022)</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>School Board Commissioner</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Sun sign</td><td>–</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Faauuga_Moliga-_Relationship_Married_Life>Faauuga Moliga- Relationship, Married Life</span></h2><p>Faauuga is the proud father of three children. He has two daughters who attend a public school in the San Francisco region. His children were formerly enrolled at a school outside of the city, but they have since transferred to a San Francisco private high school. Moliga has not revealed anything else about his wife’s identity or how he met her before entering into marriage vows.</p><h2><span id=Faauuga_Moliga-_Professional_Career>Faauuga Moliga- Professional Career</span></h2><p>Faauuga has worked for a variety of projects, including a student advocate program aimed at assisting chronically absent pupils. Following this initiative, he tried his hand with the working body of Burton High School, where he increased school attendance while simultaneously aiming to reduce the school’s drop-out rate. Faauuga assisted in extending support for the PUMA prevent project while he was linked with Burton. Moliga began his studies at San Jose State University’s School of Social Job after finishing his work with Burton. His work was related with a focus on mental health and social justice.</p><p>Despite this, he interned for the SFUSD student intervention team and spent a year at Carver Elementary School working on system-wide support and individual counseling of students and educators. Moliga graduated from a recognized institution or university and was afterward hired as a therapist at June Jordan High School by the Richmond Area Multi-Services. Today, he works for the Department of Public Health Community Wellness Program, where his job is to establish wellness centers for kids at Downtown High School, where he does his tasks once a week.</p><h2><span id=Body_Measurements_Height_Weight_Hair_color>Body Measurements: Height, Weight, Hair color\</span></h2><table style=height:100%;width:100%><tbody><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 5’ 6” –&nbsp;</strong>in Centimeters&nbsp;<strong>– 168 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 69 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 152 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Shoe Size</td><td>8 (U.S.)</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Body Type</td><td>Average</td></tr></tbody></table><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>School Board Commissioner</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Tremaine Emory</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Tiera Skovbye</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfm66iwdSgmGaln6G2qK2O</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./feeya-iskandar.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Feeya Iskandar">&larr;
