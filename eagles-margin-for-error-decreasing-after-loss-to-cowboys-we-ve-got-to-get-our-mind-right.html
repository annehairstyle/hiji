He was silent. He was despondent. He was one player among many on the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=54 href=#>Philadelphia Eagles</a> dealing with the duality of being blown out twice in two weeks but still sharing the <a class=ath_autolink data-id=2 href=#>NFL</a>’s best record, of making repetitive mistakes after so often transcending them, of prompting a crowd of <a class=ath_autolink data-id=39 href=#>Dallas Cowboys</a> fans to chant “Eagles suck” while having proven before the chant isn’t true.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>It’s a confounding existence for a collection of competitors, to be one of the reasons a championship is expected but also one of the reasons it may not arrive. Smith lost a fumble. So did <a class=ath_autolink data-id=EJI9GRcayoZKGPpF href=#>A.J. Brown</a>. So did <a class=ath_autolink data-id=yhzPJprUoEnfzPvf href=#>Jalen Hurts</a>. The team’s most trustworthy trio turned the ball over three times after entering <a href=#>Cowboys</a> territory. Each one prevented points in a <a href=# rel=noopener>33-13 loss</a> at AT&T Stadium on Sunday night, the first game in coach Nick Sirianni’s three-year tenure in which the Philadelphia offense failed to score a touchdown.</p><p>The Eagles began the 2023 season on pace to break several team records. They’re now setting the wrong ones and headed backward with fatal flaws that remain unresolved. The Eagles are now 10-3 and tied with the Cowboys and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=58 href=#>San Francisco 49ers</a> for the NFC’s No. 1 seed. But with four regular-season games to go, a deep playoff run, much less a first-round bye, is beginning to feel like the third-quarter throw from Hurts to Smith on Sunday that fell harmlessly in the end zone: just inches out of reach.</p><p>“I’m playing terrible,” Smith said. “Gotta play better.”</p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>NFL playoff picture: Dolphins blow chance to stick with Ravens atop AFC</p></a><p>Who wasn’t playing terrible? The <a href=#>Eagles</a> buried themselves with their most dreadful first half yet. Of Philadelphia’s six straight halftime deficits, Dallas secured the largest at 24-6. An increasingly troubling Eagles defense that surrendered six straight touchdowns in <a href=# rel=noopener>last week’s loss to the 49ers</a> couldn’t stop the Cowboys, either, who scored three touchdowns and a field goal on their four first-half possessions. The defense became so blatantly unreliable that Sirianni called for a fake punt from his own 33 on the Eagles’ second drive of the game. Although punter <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Jw84ftmmURjvjdnq href=#>Braden Mann</a>’s 28-yard pass to <a class=ath_autolink data-id=eHKpRB4edXrxSgzq href=#>Olamide Zaccheaus</a> reached the Cowboys’ 39, Philadelphia’s offense failed to convert another first down and settled for a field goal.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>“Nobody’s playing well enough right now for us to win these games,” said defensive end <a class=ath_autolink data-id=nMs1a7rVTKxtFiSB href=#>Haason Reddick</a>.</p><p>Indeed. Reddick sacked <a class=ath_autolink data-id=1NrLfCowWevnKYEe href=#>Dak Prescott</a> in the second quarter, but two plays later on third-and-6, rookie cornerback <a class=ath_autolink data-id=n7ElvZKFJUJQivjj href=#>Kelee Ringo</a> surrendered an 8-yard catch while also getting flagged for both pass interference and a face mask penalty. The Eagles entered the weekend with the NFL’s worst third-down defense (47.3 percent conversion rate), and in addition to the Cowboys converting 9 of 16 third downs on Sunday, Philadelphia helped them convert three more with defensive penalties. Ringo’s in that third-and-6 situation helped produce a Cowboys touchdown. Cornerback <a class=ath_autolink data-id=XbcJ9BbxN4jskljf href=#>Darius Slay</a> was also penalized for pass interference on a third-and-17 in the first quarter that eventually yielded a 60-yard field goal by <a class=ath_autolink data-id=aykbyHg70zurdiPF href=#>Brandon Aubrey</a>.</p><p>The penalties compounded persistent problems within an Eagles secondary that defensive coordinator Sean Desai still hasn’t figured out how to best maximize. Desai abandoned his recent usage of <a href=# rel=noopener>Slay shadowing the opponent’s No. 1 receiver</a>, which was curious because it was the team’s first game against the Cowboys in Philadelphia that prompted the strategy. Instead, Desai chose to keep Slay as the wide corner on the short side of the field. The Cowboys entered the game having often targeted one-on-one matchups in that region, Slay said. By using their No. 1 corner to lock down the receiver on that end, the Eagles wanted to force Prescott to throw to the long end of the field.</p><p>Desai’s game plan required confidence in the depth of his secondary that wasn’t rewarded. Nickel cornerback <a class=ath_autolink data-id=RRUx97ATeV6i6qRE href=#>Bradley Roby</a>, who was sidelined with a shoulder injury when <a class=ath_autolink data-id=Zk5GgVex9l3q9BqS href=#>CeeDee Lamb</a> logged a career-high 191 yards in Philadelphia, also failed to contain the Cowboys’ Pro Bowl receiver. On the game’s first drive, Prescott found Lamb wide open on third-and-2 for a 13-yard touchdown with Roby trailing in pursuit.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Dak and CeeDee wasting no time with an opening drive TD</p><p>📺: <a href=#>#PHIvsDAL</a> on NBC<br>📱: Stream on <a href=#>#NFLPlus</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/YCEDNi5Ozb</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/aOxzGl0RQE</a></p><p>— NFL (@NFL) <a href=#>December 11, 2023</a></p><p>Prescott was 24-of-39 passing for 271 yards and two touchdowns, while frequently busting the Eagles’ coverages. He delivered a third-and-6 pass over the middle to tight end <a class=ath_autolink data-id=NxzrBEjSQFfzLIrh href=#>Jake Ferguson</a> for a 32-yard gain in the third quarter that produced a 59-yard field goal by Aubrey.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>Meanwhile, the Cowboys gashed the Eagles on the ground at 4.3 yards per carry. On Dallas’ third scoring drive, Prescott and running backs <a class=ath_autolink data-id=qsrF8CVWw24iwJ2Q href=#>Rico Dowdle</a> and <a class=ath_autolink data-id=v0cZTIrAKEC0JWM8 href=#>Tony Pollard</a> combined for 32 yards on a series of crafty runs with confounding motions that led to a 1-yard score by Dowdle.</p><p>“Usually the Eagles are known for defense,” Slay said. “So, we’ve got to be known for it. We’ve got to get back out there and really impose our will.”</p><p>It’s uncertain if the Eagles will reclaim such dominance under Desai, whose default response to questions about his system has been a vague variation of, “I’ve got to do a better job of putting our guys in better positions.” Lack of depth is no longer a reasonable excuse. Roby has played in four straight games. Linebacker <a class=ath_autolink data-id=pbWBgXLXPMF9IaNS href=#>Zach Cunningham</a> returned from his hamstring injury on Sunday. <a href=# rel=noopener>Newly signed linebacker Shaquille Leonard</a> made his Eagles debut with a decent dosage of snaps. But Philadelphia has given up 30-plus points in three straight games after allowing 21.2 points in its previous 10.</p><p>“S—, we’ve got to get our mind right,” Slay said. “Because we do got time left. But it’s getting smaller and smaller every week.”</p><p>The defense did provide points of its own this time. Defensive tackle <a class=ath_autolink data-id=iCvfhO9lbLAFYFLM href=#>Jalen Carter</a> returned Fletcher Cox’s strip-sack for a 42-yard touchdown to bring the Eagles within 24-13 with 10:52 left in the third quarter. It was the sort of game-breaking play that had fueled four second-half comebacks in October and November. But the Eagles offense failed to draw the team within a single score.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Jalen Carter returns the fumble for a TD!</p><p>📺: <a href=#>#PHIvsDAL</a> on NBC<br>📱: Stream on <a href=#>#NFLPlus</a> <a href=#>https://t.co/YCEDNi5Ozb</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/rmAk9mxZQk</a></p><p>— NFL (@NFL) <a href=#>December 11, 2023</a></p><p>Their problems culminated in a four-play sequence at the end of the third quarter. Down 27-13 at the Dallas 32, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=cWsPQC7Rmam5Z0pU href=#>D’Andre Swift</a> was initially dropped for a 1-yard loss. Hurts then hurled a shot to Smith in the end zone that fell just beyond the wideout’s reach. Sirianni, knowing they were in four-down territory, said they called a short crosser to Brown that they hoped would have found more space than the 3 yards Brown managed to gain. Suddenly, the Eagles faced a fateful fourth-and-8.</p><p>The Cowboys pressured Hurts steadily all night. They sacked him once. They hit him twice. They forced him to underthrow a third-and-6 pass in the third quarter by sending a heavy blitz. They rushed Hurts again with six defenders on the fourth-and-8. Sirianni said the Eagles anticipated the heavy rush, which was paired with man coverage. They called a play they “felt pretty good” about against the look. Smith ran a short crosser to the left, and it appeared Brown, who ran a longer crosser to the right, was supposed to impede Smith’s defender, <a class=ath_autolink data-id=LHHA7M8fVh0F5ywk href=#>Stephon Gilmore</a>, with his route. But Gilmore ducked under Brown and tackled Smith for a turnover on downs.</p><p class=ad-slug>Advertisement</p><p>“Came up short there,” said Hurts, who finished 18-of-27 passing for 197 yards.</p><p>The Eagles can’t afford to come up short much longer. The margin for error is decreasing. They can salvage their season starting with a Monday night game against a depreciating <a class=ath_autolink data-id=57 href=#>Seattle Seahawks</a> team that’s lost four straight. They’ll then close with a three-game stretch that includes playing the 3-10 <a class=ath_autolink data-id=31 href=#>Arizona Cardinals</a> and twice facing the 4-8 <a class=ath_autolink data-id=51 href=#>New York Giants</a>. Perhaps within those games, the Eagles can find the solutions they desperately need.</p><p><span>“It’s something we’re going through, not something we’re stuck in,” Hurts said. “I think that will for this team to get things done is going to continue to be challenged. It’s all about how we respond to it. I think it’s a beautiful opportunity for us. We have to have a hunger, a will and want-to. I think we’ve got the right guys to do that.”</span></p><a href=# class=go-deeper><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.theathletic.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=128" alt=go-deeper style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=go-deeper-label>GO DEEPER</p><p class=go-deeper-title>NFL Power Rankings Week 15: Chaos in the AFC, plus a fantasy spotlight for every team</p></a><p>(Photo: Tim Heitman / USA Today)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqutbTLnquim16YvK57lGppcG9pbnxzfJFsZmpqX2Z%2BcLHAoKOeq12YvLiuzrKqZqaWmHqxuMCypp%2Beo2Q%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./eliud-kipchoge-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eliud Kipchoge Net Worth 2024">&larr;
