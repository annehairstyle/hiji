Well maybe at least some sort of inclination towards one, so what is <a href=# rel=noopener>Riri’s</a>?</p><p><strong>Rihanna has two favorite colors: green and black. She has hit up different events in both colors many times in the past. It is common for people to want to wear their favorite color. On top of this, having a favorite color can actually tell you a lot about a person’s personality.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You can read more below about what Rihanna’s favorite colors indicate about her personality and the different times she has worn green or black outfits in public.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Favorite Color Says About Personality</h2><p>Color has huge implications historically and culturally. The color black has historically been associated with mourning in the Western world and the color white is associated with weddings. Meanwhile, in Buddhist countries, the <a href=# rel=noopener>color white indicates mourning</a>. Interestingly enough, in the Victorian era people would send secret messages to the people they were courting with different colors of flowers. This <a href=# rel=noopener>was known as floriography</a>, an entire language surrounding colors and types of flowers.</p><p>So it should come as no shock that preferring a certain color can actually indicate different personality attributes. According to this <a href=# rel=noopener>Psychology Today article</a>, it says that you can perform something known as The Color Test. Through this test, you can determine the personality of different people in a group based on what color of crayon they pick to write with.</p><p>The color test article has the following the say about people who pick <a href=# rel=noopener>the color black</a>. “People who choose black as their favorite color are often artistic and sensitive.&nbsp; While these people aren’t introverts, they are careful with the details of their lives and do not share easily with others.”</p><p>The color <a href=# rel=noopener>green is a bit different</a>. “Those who love the color green are often affectionate, loyal and frank.&nbsp; Green lovers are also aware of what others think of them and consider their reputation very important.”</p><p>From Rihanna’s public image, it seems that she is the perfect mixture of the two personalities. She is clearly artistic, but she is also so frank.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rihanna Decked Out in Green</h2><p>There have been plenty of times throughout the years that Rihanna has sported the color green. In <a href=# rel=noopener>this Pinterest photo</a>, you can see Rihanna in a blue and green plaid jacket. In another Pinterest post, you can see the <a href=# rel=noopener>outfit that Rihanna wore on stage</a> at the 2016 Made In America Festival. She was seen wearing a green bodysuit complete with green full leg boots that were held up by a belt.</p><p>In 2019, Rihanna wore a <a href=# rel=noopener>stunning mint green minidress</a> to the Fashion Awards in London. The dress was designed by her own fashion brand <a href=# rel=noopener>Fenty</a>. Along with the dress, Riri wore a huge shawl that was held up by diamond straps.</p><p>Follow the below YouTube link to see Rihanna wearing the green full leg boots while performing her song B**** Better Have My Money live in concert.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Back In Black</h2><p>Rihanna has worn black a lot. From all black attire at NBA games to her black <a href=# rel=noopener>Jean Paul Gaultier gown</a> worn at the AMAs, Badgalriri sure loves the color. On the airport runway in Barbados, Rihanna was spotted wearing a long black skirt with a huge thigh revealing slit in it as is shown in this <a href=# rel=noopener>Popsugar piece</a>.</p><p>After the Fashion Awards in London and her mint green minidress, Riri opted for an <a href=# rel=noopener>all black ensemble</a> to the afterparty. Most recently though, she made fashion history by gracing the cover of Vogue UK’s May 2020 issue in a black durag.&nbsp;<br>As <a href=# rel=noopener>Funmi Fetto at Vogue</a> says “The ultimate purpose of the durag when it was first conceived was neither about choice nor functionality. It was enforced, a method to suppress black women’s beauty and distinguish their lowly, inferior status as labourers.” With Rihanna wearing it on the cover of Vogue, it is symbolic of how the fabric has been taken back by black women as a signifier of style.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jrCfmqxdnsBuvsihmKemkah6p63VqKmirJVisLC4zqtm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-cameron-johnson-dating-cameron-johnson-s-girlfriend-exes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Cameron Johnson Dating  Cameron Johnson's Girlfriend &amp;amp; Exes">&larr;
