However, people wonder why they never hear anything about his children. Or did they decide not to be as controversial as their father?</p><p><strong>Andy Warhol lived to age 58, and did not have children when he was alive. He never got married as well.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebanswers.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Andy-Warhol-Grey82-1024x683.jpg><p>Let’s take a peek at the artist’s personal life–which seems to be just as colorful as his pop art paintings.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Did Andy Warhol have baby mamas?</strong></h2><p>Andy Warhol lived his life as a homosexual during a period when a large percentage of people held homophobic views. The openly gay artist was among the public figures who paved the way for the LGBTQ community to thrive.</p><p>When he was in his 30s, he got into a relationship with former actress and model Edie Sedgwick. They had a short-lived romance, and Edie played the lead in most of the films he produced.</p><p>She died of an overdose in 1971 when she was 28 years old.</p><p>Fans speculated that they were married. However, all those rumors were debunked when people found out that the artist was gay.</p><p>Andy Warhol and Edie Sedgwick didn’t have any children together. He was not romantically involved with any other women in his lifetime.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Why didn’t Andy Warhol have kids?</strong></h2><p>During the 1950s and 1960s, gender and sexuality were considered taboo, and most people held highly-conservative views in those areas.&nbsp;</p><p>It was an entirely different landscape for the LGBTQ community during that time. Same-sex couples couldn’t get married, making it impossible for them to adopt children and live normal family lives like heterosexual couples.</p><p>Although we can’t say that this was why Andy Warhol didn’t have kids, it was most definitely a deciding factor for him. Plus, even if he wanted to have kids, he most likely couldn’t because of the strict state laws.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>What was Andy Warhol’s net worth before he died?</strong></h2><p>In 2021, after calculating all that Andy Warhol left behind (with inflation), his total net worth before he died was $220 million. The artist was famous for his soup can drawings and experimental films, Empire and Chelsea Girls.</p><p>His movies didn’t make commercial success and only premiered in underground theatres and at his studio, The Factory. When he was still alive, the studio was a hub for creatives, celebrities, drag queens, street artists, and more.</p><p>Even in his death, his artwork seemed to be raking in profit because his paintings of Marilyn Monroe sold for hundreds of millions of dollars at an art auction.&nbsp;</p><p>The artist suffered an assassin hit and left his employees in charge of his factory. During his hiatus, they kept making movies and selling artwork in his name. He would get commissions as well.</p><p>Well, he had a successful career as an artist and filmmaker. Even in death, his art still remained relevant and profitable.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Who did Andy Warhol will his fortune to?</strong></h2><p>Before Andy Warhol died, he wrote a will, which was a brilliant move to avoid unforeseen circumstances after his death.</p><p>Most of his estate went towards starting the <a href=# rel=noopener>Andy Warhol Foundation for The Visual Arts</a>. His aim was to create funding and access to resources for experimental artists like himself.</p><p>Andy Warhol’s manager, Frederick W. Hughes, took over the company. Then Paul and John Warhola, Andy’s siblings, inherited $250,000 each.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Did Andy Warhol’s wife inherit part of his fortune?</strong></h2><p>When the pioneer of pop art, Andy Warhol, was alive, he didn’t get married. The artist was a homosexual, and although he once had a romance with a woman, Edie Sedgwick, he remained gay until his death. Therefore, he had no wife who could inherit any part of his fortune.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Did any of Andy Warhol’s ex-boyfriends inherit his fortune?</strong></h2><p>Before Andy Warhol died, he was romantically and sexually involved with multiple men.&nbsp;</p><p>In a Netflix docuseries based on his life titled The Andy Warhol Diaries, only three of his relationships were highlighted. They are Jed Johnson, John Giorno, and Edward Wallowitch.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>According to the docuseries, his most loved partner seemed to be Jed Johnson, his boyfriend for twelve years. He was initially hired to sweep floors in Andy’s studio, but later got involved in creative work there.&nbsp;</p><p>None of his ex-boyfriends inherited anything after Warhol died.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jp2gnWWRo7G6edaaqaGnnGK1osLEZqKinKNk</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./edward-barber-height-weight-age-body-statistics.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Edward Barber Height, Weight, Age, Body Statistics">&larr;
