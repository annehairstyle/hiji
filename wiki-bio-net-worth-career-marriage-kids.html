The duo is a testament to the fact that if you try to make things work and stick with one person, things will eventually find a way. The pair who have been together for over 36 years have often kept their own counsel and rarely speak on the media about their relationship. But in a few rare interviews, the duo has given on their personal lives, both have been candid about trying to make things work. And while Denzel is undoubtedly more on the media than Pauletta, the movie star credits his wife for making things work. In this article, we will take the spotlight away from Denzel Washington and put some on his wife.</p><p><strong>Pauletta Pearson Washington is an American actress, vocalist, one-time runner-up of the Miss North Beauty pageant, and classically trained pianist. She has a net worth of $140 Million. Her zodiac is Libra.</strong> <strong>On the physical side of things, Pagan has a stature of approximately 5 feet 6 inches, a triangle body shape, dark brown eyes, and black hair color.&nbsp;She has been married to Denzel Washington since 1983 and has four children together.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Denzel-Washington-wife-Pauletta-Washington.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Pauletta and Danzel Washington Met?</h2><p>Denzel Washington first met Pauletta on the set of the TV series,&nbsp;Wilma, in 1977. The pair were introduced in the wrap-up part of the series, but the meeting was short and they were quick to go their own ways. The pair met each other the next day at a play. Pauletta and her friend were running late for the play and Pauletta ended up seating where she could find space. When the lights came on during the intermission, she was seated next to Denzel.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The third time’s the charm:</h2><p>Even though the pair began dating after running to each other in the theater, things were pretty rough for Denzel when he asked Pauletta to marry him. In an interview with Hollywood Access in 2013, Denzel revealed that he asked Pauletta to marry him twice. Only for Pauletta to correct him that it was three times. Pauletta rejected Denzel’s proposal twice before finally caving in the third time. The pair eventually ended up tying the knot on June 25, 1983.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p>In their years as a married couple, the pair have given birth to four children, John David who was born on the 28th of July, 1984, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Katia</a> born on November 27, 1987, and twins Olivia and Malcolm Washington born on April 10, 1991. All of Denzel and Pauletta’s children have found their way into the entertainment industry.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Making things work:</h2><p>It is no secret that Denzel and Pauletta are one of the few married couples in Hollywood who have been together for more than 35 years and look to be together for another 35. And while Denzel likes to joke about how he keeps his mouth shut and does as he is told, the star is quite frank about how Pauletta handed the majority of the workload in their marriage. When talking about the success of a happy marriage, Denzel <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a>,&nbsp;</p><p>“What pops into my head: security, food, a beautiful home. The difference between a house and a home, it’s a big difference. You can buy a house, but that doesn’t make it a home—and not to say a man can’t make a home a home, but my wife has made our house a home, and raised these beautiful kids, and protected them and sacrificed for them. She did the heavy lifting.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early life, career, and fame:</h2><p>Pauletta Pearson was born on the 28th of September, 1950, in North Carolina, United States. Not much is known about Pauletta’s early life and the actress has kept silence regarding her upbringing. She graduated from the University of North Carolina School of the Arts.</p><p>Pauletta first came into the public eye in 1970 when she took part in the Miss North beauty and was the first black woman to do so. She became runner-up in the competition, which propelled her to a role in the movie, Wilma, alongside Denzel. While Pauletta has made numbered appearances in movies like Purlie (1981), Beloved (1988), Antwone Fisher (2002), 90 Days (2016), and Steps (2017), she is well aware that Denzel is more in the public eye. However, it<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#> makes</a> no difference to her.&nbsp;</p><p>“When Denzel first started, I was right there, but there was no focus on me. But there’s been no less presence in his life and in my life than now. As you climb, you grow deeper in the foundation, so it makes our foundation deeper.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Philanthropy:</h2><p>In addition to her acting career, Pauletta is known for her philanthropy and different charity works. She and her husband established “Pauletta and Denzel Washington Gifted Scholars Program”&nbsp;which provides students, with an interest in science, to work on exciting research projects underway in neurosciences at Cedars-Sinai.&nbsp;Also, she is one of the founding and executive members of The Brain Trust of Cedars-Sinai – a group that raises awareness and funds for brain care and research. She has been involved with the organization for over 20 years. In 2005, she won BET humanitarian award.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>A quick write on her husband, Denzel Washington:</h2><p>Denzel Washington is an American actor, director, and producer, born on December 28, 1954, in Mount Vernon, New York. His father was a Pentecostal minister and his mother was a beauty salon owner and operator. Washington attended Fordham University, where he studied journalism, but later switched to acting.</p><p>Washington began his acting career in theater productions, and made his film debut in the 1981 movie “Carbon Copy.” He gained critical acclaim for his role as Private Silas Trip in the 1989 film “Glory,” which earned him his first Academy Award nomination and win in the supporting actor role. He went on to star in a number of successful films throughout the 1990s, including “Malcolm X,” “Philadelphia,” “The Pelican Brief,” and “The Hurricane.”</p><p>In 2001, Washington won his second Academy Award for Best Actor for his role as corrupt detective Alonzo Harris in the crime thriller “Training Day.” He went on to receive several more award nominations for his performances in films such as “Man on Fire,” “American Gangster,” and “Flight.”</p><p>In addition to his successful acting career, Washington has also directed several films, including “Antwone Fisher,” “The Great Debaters,” and “Fences.” He received critical acclaim for his direction of “Fences,” which earned him a nomination for Best Picture at the 2017 Academy Awards.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Pauletta Washington Wiki/bio Facts:</h2><figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"><table><tbody readability=7><tr><td><strong>Birth Name</strong></td><td>Pauletta Pearson</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td>Pauletta Pearson Washington</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Other Name</strong></td><td>Pauletta Washington</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Birth Date</strong></td><td>September 28, 1950</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>72 years old</td></tr><tr readability=3><td><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td>North Carolina, United States</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Gender</strong></td><td>Female</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Sexuality</strong></td><td>Straight</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ethnicity/Race</strong></td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Religion</strong></td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Education</strong></td><td>University of North Carolina School of the Arts</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Degree</strong></td><td>Bachelor of Arts</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Horoscope</strong></td><td>Libra</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Father’s Name</strong></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mother’s Name</strong></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Siblings</strong></td><td>Rita Pearson</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hair Color</strong></td><td>Black</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Eye Color</strong></td><td>Dark Brown</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Body Type</strong></td><td>Triangle</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height</strong></td><td>5 feet 6 inches (approx)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Relationship Status</strong></td><td>Committed</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Marital Status</strong></td><td>Married</td></tr><tr readability=2><td><strong>Husband</strong></td><td>Denzel Washington (m.1983-present)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td><strong>Children</strong></td><td>John David Washington,&nbsp;Katia Washington,&nbsp;Olivia Washington,&nbsp;Malcolm Washington</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Actress, Vocalist,</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td>$140 Million</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Social Media</strong></td><td>Inactive</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwprjEm6qippake6S7zGinmq2cmsG1rYywmKygmaO0tbvNaA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./me-shell-ndegeocello-fool-of-me-l.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="                    Me'shell Ndegeocello                                          Fool Of Me l">&larr;
