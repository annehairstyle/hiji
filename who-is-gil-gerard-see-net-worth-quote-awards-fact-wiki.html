Gerard Wiki Biography<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Gilbert C. Gerard was born on 23 January 1943, in Little Rock, Arkansas USA, and is an actor, best known for being part of the television series “Buck Rogers in the 25th Century” as the title character. All of his efforts have helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is Gil Gerard? As of early-2017, sources estimate a net worth that is at $1 million, mostly earned through his career as an actor, active in the industry since the 1970s including commercials, films, and various television shows. All of these achievements have ensured the position of his wealth.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=gil-gerard-net-worth-1-million></span>Gil Gerard Net Worth $1 million<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Gil first became involved in acting while attending Little Rock Catholic High School for Boys, meantime also working at a Kroger grocery store. After matriculating, he attended Maryknoll Seminary and became part of the production “The Music Man” in the title role. He then went on to attend the University of Central Arkansas but dropped out before graduating.</p><p>Gerard started working as an industrial chemist and after a few years he would become a regional manager of the company, but as he did not have a degree, he resigned as he couldn’t undertake the required master’s course, but his net worth was well established. He then moved to New York City to study acting, and would work as a taxicab driver to pay expenses, doing which he would meet someone who invited him to the set of “Love Story” , and was hired as an extra.</p><p>He mostly did commercials early in his career, including becoming a spokesman for the Ford Motor Company, then had a small role in 1971’s “Some of My Best Friends Are…”, a gay-themed film. Three years later he was part of “Man on a Swing” which is a murder mystery thriller film, and then got his first major role in the TV soap opera “Doctors”, which he joined for two years. His net worth was starting to increase, so he was then able to start his own production company. He created the screenplay called “Hooch”, which he co-wrote and produced.</p><p>In 1977, Gil co-starred with Yvette Mimieux in “Ransom for Alice!”, then had a part in “Airport ‘77”, the third installment of the “Airport” franchise. He was given a guest appearance on “Little House on the Prairie” which led him to be cast in the television movie “Killing Stone”. Eventually, he would get his best known role in “Buck Rogers in the 25th Century”, which increased his net worth significantly, as he stayed with the show from 1979 to 1981.</p><p>Afterwards, Gil appeared in several television shows, most of which were short lived. In the 1990s, he continued to make guest appearances in shows such as “Days of Our Lives” and “Pacific Blue”. In 2007, he became the subject of the documentary “Action Hero Makeover” which documented his progress after undergoing mini-gastric bypass surgery, and in the same year, he reunited with “Buck Rogers” co-star Erin Gray for the TV movie “Nuclear Hurricane”.</p><p>One of his latest projects was appearing in an episode of “Star Trek: Phase II”. He also lent his voice to “Transformers: Robots in Disguise”.</p><p>In his personal life, Gil married Connie Sellecca in 1979, but they divorced in. He married Bobi Leonard in the same year, and it lasted for two years, since when he has been single.</p><p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p><table><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Gil Gerard</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>January 23, 1943</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Little Rock, Arkansas, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6′ 1″ (1.85 m)</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor, Producer, Director</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>University of Central Arkansas</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Bobi Leonard (m. 1987–1989), Connie Sellecca (m. 1979–1987)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Bobi Leonard (m. 1987–1989), Connie Sellecca (m. 1979–1987)</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>Gib Gerard</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>https://www.facebook.com/GilGerardFans</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001266/</td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>People’s Choice Award for Favorite Actor in a New TV Series</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, Airport ’77, Nuclear Hurricane, The Lost Valentine, Bone Eater, The Stepdaughter, Fugitive Mind, Ghost Town, Mom, Can I Keep Her?, Stormin’ Home, Fury to Freedom, Air Rage</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>E.A.R.T.H.
