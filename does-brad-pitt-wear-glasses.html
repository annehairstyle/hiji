For actors with poor sight, there’s always glasses to help with their vision. Is Brad Pitt one of such actors? Does Brad Pitt wear glasses?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Brad Pitt wears glasses. He once wore glasses and was seen wearing them numerous times both on and off movie sets. What kind of glasses does he prefer, and why does he wear glasses? You will find the answers to these questions and more in this article.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brad Pitt’s Poor Eyesight</h2><p>Glasses are used for several reasons. Some of such reasons are as a basic fashion accessory to accentuate certain facial features and (or) to protect the eyes from bright light and UV rays. These reasons are great, but for most persons, the primary reason for wearing glasses is to correct certain eye defects such as near or farsightedness.</p><p>Up until 2010, Brad Pitt had the same reason for wearing glasses.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The blue-eyed movie star suffered from poor eyesight</a> for sometime before seeking medical help. Friends and fans ridiculed him for his failure to recognize them. Unknown to them, he had an eye defect that was yet to be diagnosed.</p><p>To get this issue resolved, the <a href=# rel=noopener>Ocean’s Eleven</a> actor <a href=# rel=noopener>opted to go in for laser eye surgery</a> and have his sight corrected.</p><p>Although the actor isn’t quite vocal about having had the procedure, the surgery has helped him to <a href=# rel=noopener>dispense with the need to wear “uncool” glasses or contact lenses regularly</a>.</p><p>He has also been able to fit into easily and play different roles and characters. Also, he dumped glasses for contacts that are more comfortable and fashionable.</p><p>The surgery was, however, successful, and if the actor is seen wearing glasses now, they are merely a style accessory and not necessarily a tool for improving his eyesight.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Brad Pitt’s Choice of Glasses</h2><p>Any Hollywood style icon list that fails to include Brad Pitt has to be defective. The star actor who was named <a href=# rel=noopener>best dressed while in high school and has been voted sexiest man alive</a> twice by People has worn different fashionable pairs of eyewear throughout his career. Some of these glasses are considered below.</p><p>In the biographical comedy-drama movie <a href=# rel=noopener>The Big Short</a> (which tells the concurrent stories of individual characters and their actions in the buildup to the 2007 housing market crash), Brad Pitt played the role of Ben Rickert, a retired former trader of securities.</p><p>His character consistently wore a pair of clear <a href=# class=rank-math-link rel=noopener>silhouette glasses</a>, and Brad must have become attached to them because he still <a href=# rel=noopener>wore a slightly tinted version of them to the movie’s premiere</a>.</p><p>This fits him perfectly, and he just had to rock them a second time. It also made his appearance close to him as he was wearing something similar to his character in the movie.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter"></figure><p>Before 2019, Brad Pitt had not made an appearance on the red carpet of the Cannes Film Festival in over seven years.</p><p>The actor while promoting the Quentin Tarantino movie Once Upon A Time In Hollywood <a href=# rel=noopener>was on the red carpet at the 72nd annual Cannes Film Festival</a>. The stylish actor <a href=# rel=noopener>plus a fancy pair of glasses</a>.</p><p>The glasses are called the “Calabar” and are made by Garrett Leight California Optical, a boutique eyewear brand.</p><p>The Calabar is a tweak of the classic wayfarer shape and blends retro with modern quite easily.</p><p>They cost about 340 dollars, a bit pricey but something Brad can afford.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p>Similarly, <a href=# rel=noopener>at the screening of Killing Them Softly in Cannes, France</a>, Brad Pitt sports a classic black tuxedo and a Sama Eyewear’s 1250 dollars pair of glasses. This pair of aviators were made from pure titanium. Its mirror lens is vapor coated in rose gold.</p><p>Therefore, it is clear that Brad Pitt wears glasses and that they always look good on him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jp2mnqtdl7%2BisIypoK2sXayyor6MoKOaq6OawHA%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dude-perfect-net-worth-2020.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dude Perfect Net Worth 2020">&larr;
