Some celebs are charitable to the point it seems like it’s their second job, while others slip under the radar. Does one of <a href=# rel=noopener>Britain’s wealthiest musicians</a>, Adele, give to charity?</p><p><strong>Yes, Adele gives to charity. Adele has a big heart. She has performed at multiple charity events and is also a large contributor to the MusiCares and SANDS charities. Adele has supported charities for those with learning disabilities, HIV/AIDS, LGBTQ rights, and many more. She was also married to the CEO of the charitable foundation Drop4Drop, Simon Konecki.</strong></p><p>You can read more about Adele’s contributions to charities and just how big her contributions have been by scrolling down.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Adele’s Performances for Charity</h2><p>Adele has appeared as a performer at a string of charity events throughout her only decade long professional career. In 2007 and 2008, she performed for <a href=# rel=noopener>Little Noise Sessions</a>. The money raised by this event was <a href=# rel=noopener>donated to Mencap</a>, a charity that works with people with learning disabilities. Also in 2008, she <a href=# rel=noopener>attended</a> the Keep a Child Alive’s Black Ball where money was raised for support services for HIV/AIDS affected communities in Africa and India.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2009, Adele, along with fellow BRIT School Alumni Leona Lewis, as well as Kelly Clarkson, Miley Cyrus, Jennifer Hudson, and Jordin Sparks, headlined <a href=# rel=noopener>VH1’s Divas</a>. This is a charitable event that raises money for the <a href=# rel=noopener>Save the Music Foundation</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Adele was the opening act for John Mayer’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Holiday Charity Revue</a>. Money raised from this event was donated to the charitable foundation Toys for Tots. She had also performed a free concert for Pride London and appeared on the UK charity telethon known as <a href=# rel=noopener>Red Nose Day</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>MusiCares and SANDS Donations</h2><p>Throughout her career, Adele has continuously supported two charitable organizations. The first of the two, MusiCares, is the charity run by the recording academy, the GRAMMYs. On their website, the <a href=# rel=noopener>mission statement</a> says “MusiCares provides a safety net of critical assistance for music people in times of need. MusiCares’ services and resources cover a wide range of financial, medical and personal emergencies, and each case is treated with integrity and confidentiality.”&nbsp;</p><p>Adele has supported MusiCares through a few different avenues. In 2009, she performed live at their charity concert in Los Angeles. Then in 2011 and 2012, she donated a bunch of autographed items for the charity’s auction.</p><p>Adele has also shown overwhelming support for SANDS, Stillborn and Neonatal Death Society. This charity has the following <a href=# rel=noopener>mission statement</a> “We work to reduce the number of babies dying and to improve care and support for anyone affected by the death of a baby.”</p><p>For her Adele Live Tour for the album 21, Adele required anyone receiving complimentary or backstage tickets to donate $20 USD, which would go to the charity SANDS. Her requirements were stipulated in <a href=# rel=noopener>this document</a> sent to promoters. The document states that $13,000 was raised during the European leg of the tour.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Support for the Victims of the Grenfell Tower Fire</h2><p>Outside of her support for a multitude of charities, Adele joined thousands of other Londoners to mourn the 72 victims of the <a href=# rel=noopener>Grenfell Tower fire</a>. It was during the memorial that cameras caught Adele among the crowd of mourners, singing along to the song Lean On Me.</p><p>Adele also went out of her way to visit the Chelsea fire station where she brought the first responders some cake. She wanted to show her support for the heroes and the efforts they made surrounding the fire. The station manager recalled in <a href=# rel=noopener>this Independent article</a> that “She came in, came up to the mess and had a cup of tea with the watch and then she joined us for the minute’s silence.”</p><p>The same article also quotes a witness who spotted Adele visiting the building the day after the fire “going around and hugging everyone she could to comfort them.” Follow the YouTube link below to watch Adele singing at the Grenfell Tower memorial.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jp2mnqtdlrGmuMRmnqKulWLBsHnCoZiroaSufA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./don-nelson.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Don Nelson">&larr;
